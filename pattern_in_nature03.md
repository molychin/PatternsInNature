People dreamed of an ordered universe even in ancient times—perhaps especially then, when they were more vulnerable to the random whims of nature. “God, wishing that all things should be good, and so far as possible nothing be imperfect,” wrote the Greek philosopher Plato in the fourth century BCE, “reduced the visible universe from disorder to order, as he judged that order was in every way better.” Plato imagined a universe created using geometric principles, based on ideas about harmony, proportion, and symmetry. It is a vision that has resonated strongly ever since. Symmetry is one of the key concepts that modern physicists use to understand the world, and they believe its deepest laws will show this feature.

即使在古代，人们也梦想能够有一个有序的宇宙，尤其是当他们在自然的随意性面前表现更为脆弱。“上帝，希望一切都将是美好的，尽可能地做到没有什么事物是不完美的。”希腊哲学家Plato在公元前四世纪写道，“他把可见的宇宙从无序变为有序，因为他认为秩序在各个方面都更好。”Plato运用几何原理，基于和谐、比例和对称性设想了一个宇宙。这是一个从那时起就一直引起强烈共鸣的景象。对称性是现代物理学家用来理解世界的关键概念之一，他们相信最艰深的规律将显示出这一特征。

What exactly are these properties of symmetry and pattern that we find in nature, and where do they come from? The best way to understand symmetry is as a property of an object or structure that allows us to change it in some way while leaving it looking just the same as it was before. Think of a sphere: you can rotate it any way you like, and you’d never know: it appears unchanged.

我们在自然界中发现的对称性和模式究竟是什么性质，它们是从哪里来的？理解对称性的最好方法是作为一个物体或结构的属性，它允许我们以某种方式改变它，同时使它看起来和原来一样。【对称的不变性】想象一个球体：你可以随心所欲地旋转它，你永远不会知道，它已经发生改变了，它似乎一直没有变化。【辐射对称的旋转不变性】

Or think of the grid of lines on a piece of graph paper. If you move the paper exactly one grid square’s width in a direction parallel to the lines, the grid is superimposed on how it looked at the outset. These are both symmetries, but of different kinds. The sphere has so-called rotational symmetry, meaning that its appearance is unchanged by rotation. The graph paper has (ignoring the edges) translational symmetry:
a “translation” here means a movement in a particular direction. The sphere in fact has perfect rotational symmetry, meaning that it is symmetrical for any angle of rotation. Imagine instead a soccer ball made from hexagonal and pentagonal patches sewn together: only certain rotation angles will superimpose the hexagons and pentagons exactly on their initial positions.

或者想象一张方格纸纸上的线条。如果你平行于横线向上移动一个方格的宽度，那么网格重叠在原来的格子线上，使它开起来和开始时一样。【轴对称的平移不变性】这些都属于不同类型的对称性。球体具有所谓的旋转对称性，这意味着它的外观是旋转不变的。图形纸具有（忽略边）平移对称性：这里的“变化”指的是一个特定方向的运动。球体实际上具有完美的旋转对称性，这意味着它对于任何旋转角度都是对称的。想象一下，一个由六角形和五角形补丁拼成的足球：只有一定的旋转角才能将六边形和五边形精确地叠加在它们的初始位置上。


SUBTLE SYMMETRY
The sand dollar, a kind of sea urchin, seems to pretend that it has fivefold symmetry, like a pentagon—but the oval slots undermine it.

微妙的对称  
沙子美元，一种海胆，假设它有五倍对称性，像五角大楼，但那些椭圆形槽破坏它的完美。


ARE ALL PEBBLES ALIKE?
Even pebbles have, on average, a characteristic shape that can be written in mathematical terms,which describes the range of different amounts of curvature they have over their surfaces.

所有卵石都像吗？  
即使卵石，平均而言，也可以用数学术语来描述，它们描述了它们表面上不同曲率的范围。

Another kind of symmetry is reflection, which is really just what it sounds like. If you put a mirror upright on the graph paper, the reflection in the mirror looks just like the piece of the sheet that lies behind it. This is exactly true only if the plane of the mirror is placed in just the right position:
it has to run either along one of the grid lines or exactly at the halfway point of a square, so that  the half-squares you can see and the other halves in the mirror reflection look like a full square.

另一种对称性是反射，这正是它听起来的样子。如果你把镜子直立在图表纸上，镜子里的反射就好像它背后的那张纸。只有在平面上，镜子放置在正确的位置是才是真的：它必须沿着一条网格线或者正好在一个正方形的中点上运行，这样你可以看到半正方形，而镜面反射中的另一半看起来像一个完整的正方形。

There’s another place you can put the mirror, too: exactly along the diagonals【对角线】 of the squares, at an angle of 45˚ to the grid lines. So this is another of the pattern’s “planes of symmetry【平面对称】.” If the angle is any different from 45˚, the reflection doesn’t superimpose exactly on the original grid that it hides: that isn’t a true plane of symmetry.
Mathematicians call these rotations,reflections, and translations “symmetry operations”—movements that don’t alter the appearance of the object. A plus sign and a square have the same symmetry: they have an identical set of operations that leaves them looking unchanged. A square grid, meanwhile, has a different set of operations from a hexagonal grid such as a bee’s honeycomb or chicken wire.

还有一个地方，你可以把镜子也：正好沿着对角线的正方形，在一个45角的网格线。这是另一种模式的“对称面”，如果角度与45°不同，反射就不存在。
精确地叠加在它隐藏的原始网格上：这不是一个真正的对称平面。  
数学家把这些旋转、反射和翻译称为“对称操作”——不改变物体外观的运动。加号和正方形具有相同的对称性：它们有一组相同的操作，使它们看起来不变。方形网格，同时，有一组不同的操作从六边形网格，如蜜蜂的蜂巢或鸡丝。

Bodies  
One of the most common kinds of symmetry that we see in the natural world is called bilateral symmetry. An object with this symmetry looks unchanged if a mirror passes cleanly through its middle. To put it another way, the object has a left side and a right side that are mirror images of each other. This, of course, is a characteristic of the human body, although little random quirks and accidents of our life history make the symmetry imperfect. There’s some evidence that people whose faces are more symmetrical are deemed more attractive on average, and it has also been claimed that other animals with bilaterally symmetrical bodies have more mates the more symmetrical they are.
Bilateral symmetry seems almost to be the default shape for animals. Fish, mammals, insects, and birds all share this attribute.

身体  
自然界中最常见的对称体之一称为双侧对称。如果一个镜子通过它的中间部分，这个对称的物体看起来是不变的。换一种说法，物体的左侧和右侧是镜像。当然，这是人体的一个特征，虽然我们生活史上很少的随机怪癖和事故使对称性不完美。有证据表明，脸部更匀称的人在平均情况下更具吸引力，并且还声称，其他具有双侧对称体的动物有更多的配偶，他们更对称。  
双侧对称似乎几乎是动物的默认形状。鱼类、哺乳动物、昆虫和鸟类都具有这种特性。

Why is that?

One possibility is that bilateral symmetry makes it easier to move in a specific direction: think of the streamlined gliding of a fish, compared with the awkward wriggling of a starfish. Or perhaps a bilateral body meant that such creatures could develop a spine and central nervous system, which has advantages in terms of organizing nerves into a brain. Even starfish have evolved from bilateral ancestors, and in fact their larvae are still bilateral:  
starfish only develop their fivefold symmetrical bodies as they mature into adults. This kind of shape, which can be superimposed on itself by rotating through a particular angle around one axis, is said to be “radially symmetrical.” Animals first acquired bilaterally symmetrical body designs at least half a billion years ago, and branches of the animal kingdom that don’t share  this form show that the alternatives tend to have more permissive symmetries, or none at all. There are, for example, the sponges and corals, which, with their tubular, branched, or crinkly funguslike shapes, might easily be mistaken for sea plants.  
There are tentacled anemones, which often have an approximate radial symmetry: they have an obvious top and bottom, but from the side they look the same from any angle.

为什么会这样？  
一种可能是，双边对称性使得它更容易在特定的方向上移动：想到鱼的流线型滑动，与海星的笨拙扭动相比。或者一个双侧身体意味着这样的生物可以发展脊柱和中枢神经系统，这在组织神经进入大脑方面具有优势。即使海星已经从两个祖先进化而来，事实上它们的幼虫仍然是双侧的：  
海星在成年后只发育五倍对称的身体。这种形状可以通过一个轴围绕一个特定角度旋转而叠加在一起，据说是“径向对称的”。动物至少在十亿年前首次获得了双侧对称的身体设计，而动物界的分支则不属于SH。这种形式表明，替代品倾向于具有更多的许可对称性，或者根本没有。例如，海绵和珊瑚，它们的管状、分枝状或皱缩的真菌状，很容易被误认为是海洋植物。  
有触角的海葵，通常具有近似的径向对称性：它们有明显的顶部和底部，但从侧面看，它们从任何角度看都是相同的。

“Symmetry is one of the main concepts that modern physicists use to understand the world.”

对称性是现代物理学家用来理解世界的主要概念之一。

Symmetry-breaking and patterning

All kinds of systems and processes, involving both living and non-living objects, can spontaneously find their way into more or less orderly and patterned states: they can self-organize. There is no longer any reason to appeal to some divine plan to explain this, and there is nothing mysterious about it—but that need not diminish our sense of wonder and appreciation when we see it happen. Without any blueprint or guidance, molecules, particles, grains, rocks, fluids, and living tissues can arrange themselves into regular, sometimes geometrical patterns. The laws of nature seem capable of delivering “order for free.”

对称破缺与图案化  
包括活体和非活体在内的各种系统和过程，可以自发地找到它们进入或多或少有序和图案化状态的方式：它们可以自我组织。不再有任何理由去求助于一些神圣的计划来解释这一点，它没有什么神秘的，但是当我们看到它发生时，它不需要减少我们的惊奇和欣赏的感觉。没有任何蓝图或指导，分子、粒子、谷物、岩石、流体和活体组织可以排列成规则的，有时是几何图案。自然法则似乎能够提供“自由秩序”。

Patterns appear in systems even though we can’t find any prescription for them in the fundamental rules that govern how their individual components behave. In this case, the patterns and ordering are said to be emergent: they are a property of the whole system, not deducible by looking reductively at the separate parts.
Symmetry is at the root of understanding how such patterns appear. Because in everyday terms we associate patterns with symmetry—think of the designs on wallpaper or Persian rugs, for example—we might be inclined to imagine that the spontaneous appearance of a pattern in nature involves the spontaneous generation of symmetry. In fact, the opposite is true. Pattern comes from the (partial) destruction of symmetry.

模式出现在系统中，即使我们找不到任何处方，他们的基本规则，管理他们的各个组成部分的行为。在这种情况下，模式和排序被称为是紧急的：它们是整个系统的一个属性，而不是通过在各个部分上还原地进行推断而推断出来的。  
对称性是理解这些模式如何出现的根源。因为在日常生活中，我们把图案与对称设计壁纸或波斯地毯的想法联系起来，例如，我们可能倾向于想象自然界中图案的自发出现涉及对称的自发生成。事实上，事实正好相反。模式来自对称性的（部分的）破坏。

The most symmetrical thing you can imagine is something that you can rotate, reflect, or translate any which way and yet it still looks the same. That’s true if the thing is perfectly uniform. So to get pattern from something that is initially unpatterned and uniform involves reducing the symmetry: it is what scientists call a process of symmetry-breaking, which is nature’s way of turning things that are initially the same into things that are different. The more symmetry that gets broken, the more subtle and elaborate the pattern.

你能想象到的最对称的东西是可以旋转、反射或翻译的任何东西，但它看起来还是一样的。如果事情是完全一致的，那是真的。因此，从最初没有图案化和均匀性的物体中获得图案，包括减少对称性：这就是科学家称之为对称破缺的过程，这是自然界将最初相同的事物转变成不同事物的方式。越对称越容易打破，更微妙和精细的模式。

Randomness might seem the opposite of uniformity, but the two can be equivalent: a random structure is perfectly symmetrical and uniform on average, which means that it too recognizes no “special” directions in space. In the natural world, perfect uniformity or randomness are surprisingly hard to find, at least at the everyday scale. Put yourself on a seashore. The sky is scattered with clouds, perhaps patterned into rows or feathery cirrus. The sea’s surface is wrinkled into waves that arrive on the shore with a distinctive pulse. There are plants around the shore, each with its own characteristic shape of flower and leaf. The sand at the water’s edge is grooved with ripples, and strewn with the delicate whorls of shells. All around there is shape and form: diverse, yes, but far from random, far from uniform. Symmetry is being broken, again and again.

随机性似乎与均匀性相反，但二者可以是等价的：随机结构是完全对称和均匀的，这意味着它也识别不到空间中的“特殊”方向。在自然界中，完美的均匀性或随机性是很难找到的，至少在日常尺度上是如此。设身处地。天空散布着乌云，也许是成排或羽状卷云。海面的褶皱成波浪状，以独特的脉冲到达岸边。岸边有植物，每个植物都有自己特有的花和叶的形状。水边的沙子有波纹，有细密的贝壳。周围都有形状和形式：多样性，是的，但远离随机，远离均匀。对称正在被打破，一次又一次。




ART FORMS IN NATURE

The ornate symmetries and striking colors of marine invertebrate animals such as tunicates (1) and echinoderms (2) were depicted, sometimes with a little overelaboration, by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel at the start of the twentieth century.

自然中的艺术形式  
在二十世纪初德国生物学家艾伦斯特描述了海洋无脊椎动物如鳞类动物（1）和棘皮动物（2）的华丽对称和鲜明的颜色，有时有点过于详尽。

Cause and effect  
In the natural world, when symmetry breaks we often have no cause to have anticipated it. Here’s what I mean. If we turn a random pile of bricks into the regular pattern of a wall, it’s because we have laid each brick in place. The uniform symmetry of a sheet of paper is broken in making a paper airplane because we folded it that way. In other words, the symmetry gets broken by some force—our moving hand—that compels it to break that way. It’s obvious where the symmetrybreaking came from: we put it there.

因果关系  
在自然界中，当对称打破时，我们往往没有理由预料到它。这就是我的意思。如果我们把一堆随机的砖块变成一个墙的规则图案，那是因为我们把每个砖块都放好了。纸飞机的对称性在制作纸质飞机时被打破了，因为我们把它折叠起来。换句话说，对称性被我们移动的手的某种力量打破，迫使它打破这种方式。显然对称破缺的原因是：我们把它放在那里。

Compare this to a droplet falling onto the still surface of water. At the start it is perfectly circularly symmetrical: it looks the same in any direction parallel to the surface. But then the splash develops a rim that breaks up into a series of little points, a crown that spits out little droplets from its tips. The rim no longer has its circular symmetry, but has acquired a lower grade of radial symmetry, like a starfish, in which some directions are distinct from others. The process of splashing spontaneously lowered the droplet’s own symmetry.  
In this book we will see many more examples of such symmetry-breaking. A smooth layer of water breaks up into cells of top-to-bottom circulation when it is uniformly heated from below. A block of material that is shrinking in all directions splits into a network of cracks.

将其与落在水面上的液滴进行比较。在开始时，它是完全圆对称的：在平行于表面的任何方向上看起来都是相同的。但是，飞溅形成一个边缘，形成一系列小的点，一个从顶端喷出小水滴的树冠。轮辋不再具有圆形对称，而是获得了较低等级的径向对称性，如海星，其中一些方向与其他方向不同。飞溅过程自发地降低了液滴自身的对称性。  
在这本书里，我们将看到更多这样的对称破缺的例子。光滑的水层在从底部均匀加热时分解成上下循环的细胞。在所有方向上收缩的一块材料分裂成一个裂缝网络。

Spiraling patterns form in a perfectly mixed solution of chemicals. This is how so many natural patterns form: as if by magic out of a featureless landscape.  
We can see it happen, too, on a spider’s web.  
The web itself is a gorgeous natural pattern, but it’s not a spontaneous one: the spider makes it the hard way, as we would, by stringing each thread in its place. However, catch the web while the early morning dew is still out and you’ll find it beautifully decorated with tiny beads of water hung out like rows of pearls. Did the spider put them there? Not at all—they have been self-organized as dew condensed to coat the silk threads. A thin column of water like this is unstable: it will develop a waviness that pinches it off into little beads, each one regularly spaced where the peaks of the wave were.

螺旋模式在化学品的完美混合溶液中形成。这就是如此多的自然模式的形成：仿佛是从一个无特色的风景中的魔法。  
我们也能看到它发生在蜘蛛网上。  
网络本身是一个华丽的自然模式，但它不是自发的：蜘蛛把它变成硬路，就像我们把每根线绑在它的位置一样。然而，当清晨的露水还在外面时，抓住鱼网，你会发现它装饰得很漂亮，上面挂着一排排珍珠般的小水珠。蜘蛛把它们放在那里了吗？一点也没有，它们是自组织的，凝结成丝线的露珠。像这样的薄水柱是不稳定的：它会发展成一个波纹，把它捏成小珠，每一个都有规律地在波峰处隔开。

Symmetry offers a useful way of thinking about pattern and shape, b ut even apparently irregular, totally unsymmetrical objects can have a hidden order that mathematics can reveal. Take a pebble. How would you describe its shape? It is sort of round, like a sphere but not quite. A perfect sphere is easy to define mathematically:
it has the same amount of curvature everywhere on its surface. But for a pebble, the curvature differs slightly from place to place, and from pebble to pebble. There is a range of curvatures, and the general “pebble shape” can be described by a graph showing the relative amounts of different degrees of curvature in a selection of many pebbles.

对称性提供了一种思考模式和形状的有效方式，即使显然是不规则的，完全不对称的对象也可以有一个隐藏的顺序，数学可以揭示。吃一块鹅卵石。你会如何描述它的形状？它是圆的，像球体，但不完全。完美的球面很容易在数学上定义：  
它的表面上到处都有相同的曲率。但是对于卵石，曲率从一个地方到另一个地方，从卵石到鹅卵石略有不同。有一系列的曲率，一般的“卵石形状”可以用一个图表来描述，在许多卵石的选择中，不同曲率的相对量。

Unlike a sphere, pebbles often have some parts that are concave rather than convex:  
dimples, not bulges. (Potatoes have similar shapes, and the concave parts are the bits that are hard to peel.) Mathematically, these parts are said to have negative curvature. So the graph showing the distribution of curvature of a pebble reaches into negative as well as positive values. But for any collection of pebbles, the overall graphs of curvature have the same shape! Each individual shape differs, but on average there is a single “pebble shape” described by the curvature distribution. Math reveals the common forms underlying the apparent diversity.

与球体不同，卵石通常有一些凹面而不是凸起的部分：  
酒窝，不是凸起。（土豆有相似的形状，而凹部是难以剥落的部分）数学上说，这些部分具有负曲率。因此，卵石的曲率分布图显示为负值和正值。但是对于任何鹅卵石的集合，曲率的整体曲线具有相同的形状！每个形状不同，但平均有一个单一的“鹅卵石形状”所描述的曲率分布。数学揭示了明显多样性的共同形式。

“Even apparently irregular, totally unsymmetrical objects can have a hidden order that mathematics can reveal.”

“即使是不规则的，非对称的对象有一个全阶数学CAN CAN是揭示隐藏的。”

2 FRACTALS  
Why mountains look like molehills

为什么看起来像一些琐事而山脉

If we look at an aerial photograph of a jagged coastline, without a scale bar we can’t be sure if we’re seeing a stretch that is a mile long, or ten miles, or even a hundred.

This indistinguishable appearance at different scales of magnification is a property called fractal. It is a remarkably common feature of nature: think of the fluffy edge of a cloud, or the way a twig from a branch tip mimics the shape of the whole tree, or the repeated branching of the lung’s passageways. In fact, fractals have even been called the geometry of nature. Many natural fractals look disorderly when you first see them: there’s no exact symmetry in a tree or a mountain profile. But the fractal property discloses a kind of “hidden logic” to the pattern: there’s a hierarchical repetition of the same general form at decreasing scales. What are the processes that create this logic? And why is it useful for living organisms?

如果我们看一幅锯齿状海岸线的航拍照片，没有刻度尺，我们就不能确定我们看到的是一英里长、十英里、甚至一百英里的伸展。  
在不同的放大倍数下，这种不可区分的外观是一种称为分形的性质。这是大自然的一个非常普遍的特征：想象云的边缘，或者树枝尖的枝条模仿整个树的形状，或者是肺部通道的重复分支。事实上，分形甚至被称为自然几何学。许多自然分形在你第一次看到它们时看起来是无序的：在树或山轮廓中没有确切的对称性。但分形属性揭示了一种“隐性逻辑”的模式：在递减的尺度上有相同的一般形式的层级重复。创建这种逻辑的过程是什么？为什么它对活的有机体有用呢？

Natural patterns with a symmetrical form, like the bee’s honeycomb, surprise and delight us precisely because they are rather rare.  
Nature doesn’t often display such strict order and regularity. Whether it is the spindly filigree of a naked tree’s silhouette in winter or the rugged jumble of a mountainous skyline, what we find in the wild seems more often to have a lot of unpredictability and disorder to it.  
Yet these structures have a hidden kind of pattern, too. The logic of the shape or form only becomes fully evident when we try to describe it mathematically, but we already intuit a sort of organization, even without this specialized knowledge. There is surely something pleasing and entrancing about the branching shape of a tree that we wouldn’t discover in a totally random arrangement of parts. It’s not hard to see where this magic ingredient lies. The shape of a tree is complicated, and we can’t easily describe it in the same way as we might describe a square or a hexagon. But we can give a very concise description if we focus instead on the process that produces the shape. A tree shape might be said to be “a trunk that keeps branching.”

像蜜蜂的蜂房一样，对称的自然图案，令人惊奇和高兴，因为它们是相当罕见的。  
大自然并不经常表现出如此严格的秩序和规律性。无论是冬天裸露的树的轮廓，还是崎岖不平的天际线，我们在野外发现的东西往往更具有不可预测性和无序性。  
然而，这些结构也隐藏着一种模式。当我们试图在数学上描述它时，形状或形式的逻辑就变得非常明显，但是我们已经直觉地看到了一种组织，即使没有这种专门知识。树的分枝形状肯定是令人愉快和令人着迷的，我们不会在一个完全随机排列的部分中发现它。不难看出这个神奇的成分在哪里。树的形状是复杂的，我们不能用同样的方式来描述它，就像我们描述一个正方形或六边形。但是，如果我们把注意力集中在产生形状的过程上，我们可以给出一个非常简洁的描述。树的形状可以说是“树干保持分枝”。

This description is what scientists would call an algorithm—an instruction for making a structure or,more generally, a process that has to be carried out to get what you’re after. The reason why a tree’s shape “feels” pleasing rather than incomprehensibly complicated is, I would argue, that we sense the simplicity of the algorithm needed to make it.
Even minor changes to the algorithm will produce a wide range of different treelike shapes. If the branching angle is small and the branches stay straight, we’ll end up with a poplarlike network. If the branching angle is wider and the branches can bend and twist, the result is more like an oak.

这个描述是科学家们称之为算法的指令，用来构造一个结构，或者更一般地说，是一个必须执行的过程来获得你所追求的。我认为，树的形状“感觉”令人愉悦而不是难以理解的复杂的原因是，我们感觉到它所需要的算法的简单性。  
即使对算法的微小变化也会产生各种各样的树状形状。如果分支角度很小，分支保持直线，我们最终会出现一个类似杨树的网络。如果分支角度更宽，树枝可以弯曲和扭曲，结果就更像橡树。

Looked at this way, an object that seems at first to be geometrically very complex, compared to a cone or a cube, is revealed to have an underlying simplicity. How can we describe this geometry mathematically? A tree has no real symmetry at all in the sense explained in the previous chapter: you can’t rotate or reflect it in any way to produce a shape that looks identical.  
We might be tempted to conclude that geometry has, in fact, nothing to say about this pattern. But it does. We just need a different kind of geometry. It is called fractal geometry, and it has been said to be “the geometry of nature.”

以这样的方式来看，一个最初看起来在几何上非常复杂的物体，与圆锥体或立方体相比，被揭示有一个潜在的简单性。我们怎样用数学来描述这个几何？在前一章所解释的意义上，一棵树根本没有真正的对称性：你不能以任何方式旋转或反射它来产生看起来完全相同的形状。  
我们可能会得出这样的结论：几何学实际上没有任何关于这个模式的说法。但确实如此。我们只需要一种不同的几何学。它被称为分形几何学，它被称为“自然界的几何学”。

2分形海岸线  
爱琴海的复杂边界。

The key to fractal geometry lies with the algorithmic approach to the forms it produces. What the “tree algorithm” is really saying is:  
keep making the same kind of structure (in this case, a branching junction) again and again at ever-smaller scales. Because of this repetition at different scales, a small part of a tree can resemble the whole thing. Break off the end of a branch and you have something that looks rather like a miniature tree. If you imagine continuing the branching steps without end, then you’d not really be able to tell, simply by looking at a fragment of the shape, how big it was: whether you were seeing the whole tree, or a yard-long branch segment, or a tip no longer than your thumb.

分形几何的关键在于它产生的形式的算法方法。“树算法”真正说的是：  
不断地在相同的结构（在这种情况下，分支连接）在一个更小的尺度上一次又一次地进行。因为这种重复在不同的尺度，树的一小部分可以类似于整个事物。折断树枝的末端，你看上去有点像一棵矮小的树。如果你想象不间断地继续分支的步骤，那么你就不能简单地通过看一个形状的片段，看它有多大：无论你看到的是整棵树，还是一个院子长的分支片段，或者一个不比你的拇指长的尖端。

This kind of structure that repeats again and again at smaller scales is said to be “self-similar.”Fractals are always self-similar. Their structure is“hierarchical,” which means that it is patterned over a succession of different size scales: the trunk of a tree represents one level of the hierarchy, the main branches constitute the next level, and so on.
In some natural fractals, the self-similarity of the structure extends over a wide range of scales.A coastline may be rugged and irregular over distances ranging from a yard or so (a fractured cliff edge, say) to perhaps hundreds of miles.

这种结构在较小的尺度上一次又一次重复被称为“自相似”。分形总是自相似的。它们的结构是“层次的”，这意味着它是在一系列不同大小的尺度上被图案化的：树的树干代表层次的一个层次，主要的分支构成下一个层次，等等。  
在一些自然分形中，结构的自相似性在很宽的尺度范围内延伸。海岸线可能是崎岖不平的，不规则的距离从一码左右（断裂的悬崖边缘，比如说）到几百英里。

Without any points of reference to give us clues about the scale—such as a coastal cottage on the cliff edge—we might be quite unable to tell from an aerial photograph whether we’re looking at a bay a hundred yards across or the entire coastline of a country. It’s the same for a cloud, the wispy edge of which might also have a fractal shape: if you’re shown just a bit of it, you can’t tell how much of the whole it represents.Nature can make fractals that are more orderly than the random crenellations of a coastline.

没有任何参考点来给我们提供线索，比如沿海悬崖边上的小屋，我们可能无法从航空照片中看到我们是在看一个一百码的海湾还是一个国家的整个海岸线。云也一样，它的模糊边缘也可能有一个分形形状：如果你只显示了一点，你就不知道它代表了多少。大自然可以制作出比海岸线随机的分形更有序的分形。

Some plants branch in an almost regimented progression, so that each level of the hierarchy offers a rather precise echo of the last, reduced in scale. In ferns, each Christmas-tree-shaped stem sprouts a train of sub-stems, their size diminishing steadily toward the tip even as they remain almost perfect replicas of the whole stem itself. Still more captivating is the fractal head of a Romanesco cauliflower, its conical profile embellished with smaller versions of itself over three or so hierarchical levels. Equally impressive in its way is the dragon’s blood tree of the Socotra archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with branches that repeatedly divide neatly in two.

一些植物以几乎被控制的进程分支，因此每个层次的层次提供了相当精确的最后一个回声，缩小了规模。在蕨类植物中，每棵圣诞树状的茎芽都有一系列的子茎，它们的大小向着尖端逐渐减少，即使它们仍然是整个茎本身的几乎完美的复制品。更吸引人的是罗马斯科花椰菜的分形头部，它的圆锥轮廓点缀着三多个层次的小版本。同样令人印象深刻的是印度洋索科特拉岛群岛的龙血树，其中有两个分支反复分叉。

There is a limit to the fractal branching of a tree, because real objects are made of a tangible substance that can’t become indefinitely fine in its details. If nothing else, the wiggles and crinkles can’t get smaller than the atoms from which the thing is made. There’s also an upper limit: you don’t get trees as big as mountains. So all natural objects that have a self-similar fractal structure do so only over a particular range of scales.
But some mathematical fractals sustain their self-similarity no matter how finely you look, because numbers can keep getting more minutely distinct forever. In the 1970s the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who gave fractals their name, discovered an equation that can generate a fractal boundary in “number space,” now known as the Mandelbrot set. The edges of this blobby “snowman” shape are covered in smaller blobs that, when looked at closely, resemble tiny versions of the same basic shape, sometimes with fine, jagged filaments extending outward.

树的分形分支是有限度的，因为真实的物体是由有形的物质构成的，在其细节中不可能变得无限精细。如果没有别的东西，扭动和皱褶不能比制造物体的原子更小。还有一个上限：你不会得到像山那么大的树。因此，具有类似自相似分形结构的所有自然物体仅在特定范围的尺度上这样做。
但是不管你看起来多么精细，一些数学分形都能维持它们的自相似性，因为数字可以永远保持更细微的区别。在20世纪70年代，数学家Benoit Mandelbrot给出了分形的名字，发现了一个方程式，可以在“数空间”中产生分形边界，现在称为曼德尔布罗特集。这一点点的“雪人”形状的边缘覆盖的小斑点，当仔细观察，类似于相同的基本形小版本，有时细锯齿状的细丝向外延伸。

No matter how much you magnify the shape,the same weird snowman keeps showing up.It was a shock for mathematicians, used to the calm decorum of geometric shapes, to discover that pure numbers can spawn something this elaborate, poised at the border of regularity and chaos.

“Looked at this way, an object that seems at first to be geometrically very complex is revealed to have an underlying simplicity.”

不管你放大了多少形状，同样奇怪的雪人总是出现。这对数学家来说是一种震撼，习惯于几何图形的平静，发现纯粹的数字能产生这种复杂的，在规律性和混乱的边界上摆正的东西。  
“以这种方式来看，一个最初看起来非常复杂的物体被揭示出一种潜在的简单性。”

Growing fractals

Natural fractals such as coastlines and mountain ranges are generated by a process of gradual erosion and removal of material. The opposite phenomenon of steady accumulation can also result in these capricious, unpredictable shapes.
Take the dark, branching veins called mineral dendrites that can be found lacing through rocks,with forms so irregular and seemingly organic that they were once mistaken for the fossils of primitive plants. These are a kind of creeping crystal,formed when mineral-rich fluids percolate through the rock and deposit their bounty of dissolved substances as tiny grains of insoluble salts. The grains stick together in tenuous branches, their tips advancing and splitting as they go. Or take the fluffy particles of soot formed when tiny blobs of carbonized material float through the air and stick to one another—three-dimensional fractal clusters that, under the electron microscope,resemble solid yet wispy clouds.

生长分形  
自然的分形，如海岸线和山脉，是由逐渐侵蚀和去除物质的过程产生的。稳定积累的相反现象也会导致这些反复无常的、不可预知的形状。
取走被称为矿物树突的黑暗分枝脉，它们可以通过岩石结成花纹，形状不规则，看起来像是有机的，它们曾经被误认为是原始植物的化石。这是一种爬行晶体，当富含矿物质的流体渗透到岩石中时，将溶解的物质沉积成不溶性盐的微小颗粒。谷物在纤细的树枝上粘在一起，它们的尖端随着它们的前进和劈开。或者，当碳化材料的微团块漂浮在空气中时，形成一个蓬松的烟灰颗粒，并粘附在另一个三维的分形簇上，在电子显微镜下，它看起来像固体但云雾状的云。

These are processes of aggregation: objects sticking together. What seems surprising is that this doesn’t just create dense clumps of material,but that instead the clusters sport delicate branches with lots of empty space in between.
Imagine a cloud of particles drifting along random, erratic paths through air or water,which will stick together the instant they touch.That process of aggregation will create a rather irregular cluster. Once a bump appears by chance,it will grow faster than the rest, because, purely by virtue of poking out from the surface, it is more likely to encounter another particle. The further out it protrudes, the more it grows. This is called a growth instability: there is feedback process that makes bumps self-amplifying. The randomness of the particle motions means that new bumps will appear on existing ones: they grow into arms that then branch into more arms. The branches are forever becoming elaborated into sub-branches.

这些是聚合的过程：对象粘在一起。令人惊讶的是，这不仅仅是密集的材料块，而是集群运动微妙的分支之间有很多空的空间。  
想象一团飘浮在空气或水中的不规则路径的粒子云，它们会在它们接触的瞬间粘在一起。聚集的过程会产生一个不规则的星系团。一旦碰碰出现，它会比其他物体生长得更快，因为纯粹是由于从表面戳出来，它更容易遇到另一个粒子。进一步它向外突出，它生长得越多。这被称为生长不稳定性：有反馈过程使凸起自放大。粒子运动的随机性意味着新的突起将出现在现有的突起上：它们生长成臂，然后分支成更多的臂。树枝永远被细化成支路。

And as these tendrils extend outward, the chances of an erratically moving particle finding its way between them to fill in the gaps become ever smaller: such a meandering particle is bound to touch a branch and stick there before it can penetrate far down the fjords in between. So the gaps never get filled, and the aggregation process produces fluffy,airy clusters.  
As this example shows, fractals don’t totally fill up the space that they occupy. They extend through it while leaving lots of empty space: they are not “space-filling.” A tree extends through all directions in space, but it isn’t exactly three dimensional: that would correspond instead to a solid block of wood. Similarly, mineral dendrites sprawl across the surface of a rock (they often grow over fracture surfaces where the rock has split and fluids can seep through), but don’t totally cover that surface like a spreading ink blot. This means that fractals can be considered to be objects with a dimensionality that is not an integer: they are not three-dimensional (like a cube) or two-dimensional (like a square), but two-and-a-bit-dimensional, or one-and-a-bit.

当这些tendrils向外延伸，the机会of an erratically移动粒子finding its way between them to become smaller填补in the gaps永远：such a meandering bound to touch粒子是分支和棒有在它可以穿过远down the峡湾in between。So the gaps永远不会得到填充，and the聚集过程产生蓬松，轻快的集群。  
你这节目不完全分形的例子，加油。他们占据的空间。他们从一个空洞的空间中伸出了它的位置：它们不是“太空教子”，它是通过所有的空间方向发展的，但它准确地反映了三个大小：这将意味着与一个强大的木头保持一致。类似地，矿物密度，岩石表面上的岩石表面（岩石在岩石表面裂开的地方，岩石和流体都可以穿过），但这并不意味着表面看起来像一种喷墨阻塞。这个分数可以被认为是客观的，而不是一个完整的内容：它们不是三维（像一个立方体）或两-维（像一个广场），目的是两个和一个比特的大小，或一个和一个比特。

They exist between dimensions. The larger the fractal dimension, the more of the available space it occupies; the more densely branched it is. It is from this “fractional” dimensionality that fractals get their name.
Fractal branches are so common in biology that you have to suppose they have a useful role.Think, for example, of the bifurcating passages of the lung, or the network of arteries, veins, and capillaries in the vascular system—both of them fractals with the same kind of hierarchy of branches that we see in trees. It’s fair to imagine that these branching networks convey some kind of adaptive benefit.

它们之间存在着尺寸。这一分裂主义的规模，更多的空间被占据；更高的密度。这是从“分裂主义”的角度来看，它的名称得到了他们的名称。分枝分枝是一种共同的生生学的生物，你认为他们有一个重要的角色。我们在树上。这是一个令人不安的问题。

Such a network exists to distribute vital fluids,whether that is air, blood, or the sugary sap of a plant. It’s not hard to see that the treelike structure is a good way to get fluids to all parts of the body or tissue, but that can’t be the whole answer. One big advantage of a self-similar, fractal network is that, since a part of the system mirrors the whole, the network is easy to scale up: the same principles will work for the vascular system of a pigmy shrew or an elephant, or for the branches of a japonica and a redwood.

And fractal networks are especially good at reaching throughout the body’s volume without filling it up entirely, precisely because they are “between dimensions.” It also turns out that these branching networks are the most efficient in terms of energy: their structure means that the amount of energy needed to transport the fluids to all those points is as small as it can be. That energy sa ving is a huge benefit to the organism.

这种网络存在于分配重要的流体，无论是空气、血液还是植物的含糖量。不难看出树状结构是一种很好的方法来获取身体或组织的所有部位的液体，但这并不是全部的答案。自相似分形网络的一个主要优点是，由于系统的一部分反映了整个网络，所以网络很容易放大：同样的原理适用于猪鼩或大象的血管系统，或用于粳稻和红杉的分枝。  
分形网络特别适合于在整个身体的体积内而不完全填充，因为它们是“尺寸之间的”。它还证明了这些分支网络在能量方面是最有效的：它们的结构意味着O的数量。将流体输送到所有这些点所需的能量是尽可能小的。这种能量对生物体是巨大的好处。
