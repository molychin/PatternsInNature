MANDELBROT SET  
Purely mathematical fractals can be generated by equations that pick out numbers in the two-dimensional plane: ordinary (real) numbers supply one axis (east–west), and “imaginary numbers” containing the square root of -1 are arrayed along the other (north–south). Numbers containing both real and imaginary parts occupy the plane beyond these two axes.
Shown here are fragments of the so-called Mandelbrot set at different scales of magnification.

It is traced out by an equation that takes one number and transforms it into another, which is then “fed back” into the equation in an iterative process.

Repeating this process again and again produces numbers that either stay finite or grow to become infinite. The Mandelbrot set, shown in black, is the space occupied by numbers that do not grow to infinity when subjected to this iteration. This space has an intricate structure that repeats at different scales. Coloring the rest of the space according to the rate at which the respective numbers grow to infinity reveals yet more fractal structure, producing these baroque spirals.

COSMIC FRACTALS
Turbulent flow is a fractal form in which energy is channeled down to ever finer scales, generating increasingly small structures in the process. The resulting forms can be chaotic—it’s impossible to predict exactly what they will look like or how they will evolve over time—but nonetheless they have a mathematical fractal structure that represents a kind of “hidden order.” The richness of shape and form that results is apparent in these views of the turbulent clouds of gas and dust in the Orion nebula (left) and the Tarantula nebula (see pages 76–77).

3 SPIRALS  
The math in snails and sunflowers

3螺旋  
蜗牛和向日葵的数学


We see spirals everywhere in nature, from the sea snail’s shell to the swirling gas and stars of a spiral galaxy. But do they share anything in common? On the whole, they do. Most natural spirals have a shape called logarithmic, which means that, like fractals, a small part looks just like a bigger part. A snail shell grown in such a form can stay the same shape as it gets ever bigger. Such spirals may also appear in less obvious places; the circular arrangement of florets in the head of a sunflower is made up of two sets of logarithmic spirals rotating in opposite directions. And spiral vortices form in flowing fluids, from bath water disappearing down the plughole to cyclonic storms on Earth and Jupiter. This is one of nature’s universal designs.

自然界中到处可见螺旋，从蜗牛壳到漩涡气体和螺旋星系的恒星。但是他们有什么共同点吗？总的说来，他们是这样做的。大多数的自然螺旋有一个叫做对数的形状，这意味着，像分形一样，一小部分看起来就像一个更大的部分。蜗牛壳以这样的形式生长可以保持和它越来越大的形状一样。这种螺旋也可能出现在不太明显的地方；向日葵头上的小花的圆形排列由两组相反方向旋转的对数螺旋构成。漩涡在流动的流体中形成，从沐浴水消失到塞子洞到地球和Jupiter的旋风风暴。这是大自然的普遍设计之一。

What makes spirals so special that they recur at scales from tiny to cosmic? Do these forms really share commonalities, or are their parallels just coincidental?  
Many natural spirals, like that of a snail shell, are not just any old scrolling shape. They begin with graceful, almost languid curves, but become increasingly tightly coiled as we move in toward the center. This is different from the kind of spiral made by rolling up a garden hose. In that case,the width of the coils remains the same on every turn. This is a vital distinction.

是什么让他们如此特殊的螺旋复发在尺度小宇宙吗？做这些形式真正平等分享，或是它们的相似只是巧合吗？  
许多天然的螺旋，就像一个蜗牛的壳，不只是任何旧的滚动的形状。他们开始用优美，几乎无力的曲线，但越来越紧密盘绕我们移向中心。这是不同于螺旋由卷起花园软管类。在这种情况下，线圈的宽度保持每转一。这是至关重要的区别。

The coiled-hose spiral is called an Archimedean spiral, because Archimedes described it in the third century BCE in his book On Spirals. When it appears in the physical world, that’s generally because it does indeed come from rolling up some long or flat object with a constant width: a rope, a sheet of paper or a carpet, a worm. The snail shell, meanwhile, has a form called the logarithmic spiral, because one way of writing the mathematical equation that describes it involves logarithms. This spiral has a very special property: its shape remains the same no matter how small or big it is. It is another example of a self-similar pattern.

What does self-similarity mean here? Isn’t a spiral always a spiral shape anyway? Yes, it is—but there are distinctions. For one thing, an Archimedean spiral can only get so small and no smaller. When the radius of the coil is the same as its width, you’re at the limit: you can’t coil a rope more tightly than this. But as the logarithmic spiral rotates into its center, the coils go right on getting narrower and narrower, so the curvature can get tighter and tighter. You could say that the decreasing width keeps perfect pace with the greater curvature, so that the spiraling knows no limit.

螺旋管螺旋称为阿基米德螺旋，因为阿基米德描述了他在书中对螺旋的公元前三世纪。当它出现在物质世界中，这通常是因为它确实来自卷起一些长或扁平的物体具有恒定的宽度：一根绳子，一张纸或一个地毯，蠕虫。蜗牛的壳，同时，有一种称为对数螺旋线，因为它涉及到文字描述的数学方程，对数的方法之一。这种螺旋具有非常特殊的性质：它的形状保持不变，无论多么大或小。这是自相似模式的另一个例子。  
自我相似在这里意味着什么？螺旋不是螺旋形的吗？是的，但也有区别。首先，阿基米德螺旋只能得到这么小不小。当线圈的半径宽一样，你在限制：你不能比这更紧卷绳子。但为对数螺旋旋转进入中心，线圈就越走越窄，所以曲率可以紧。你可以说，宽度减小，与更大的曲率保持完美的步伐，使螺旋没有限度。

Another way of saying this is that the spiral looks the same no matter what scale you see it on. Zoom into the center of a snail shell and the curve looks just the same as it did before. In principle, a logarithmic spiral can go on curling inward or outward forever and its form would never change.  
This self-similarity is just what a gastropod mollusk like a snail needs. As the organism grows, it needs a bigger shell. But the shell is made of hard stuff—calcium carbonate, the same mineral as chalk and marble. It can’t expand, and it would be terribly tough on the snail to be forever taking the shell apart to build a new one. So mollusks simply adds an extension, growing a larger house out from the rim of the previous one.  
The early part of the shell, now too narrow, is simply abandoned.

另一种说法是，不管你看到什么样的尺度，螺旋看起来都是一样的。放大到蜗牛壳的中心，曲线看起来和以前一样。原则上，对数螺旋可以继续向内或向外卷曲，其形状永远不变。  
这种自相似性就像腹足类软体动物一样需要蜗牛。随着生物体的生长，它需要一个更大的外壳。但外壳采用硬东西碳酸钙，矿物为粉笔和大理石一样。它不能扩大，这将是非常艰难的蜗牛永远以壳分开，建立一个新的。所以软体动物只是增加了一个扩展，越来越多的大房子从以前的边缘。  
壳的早期部分，现在太窄了，简直是被遗弃的。

Such gradual widening of the rim could produce a cone, and that’s certainly one option for the creature. But to avoid carrying an ever lengthening burden, the cone is curled up compactly into a spiral, and this is more or less what a logarithmic spiral shell is: a sort of rolled-up cone.  
So the logarithmic spiral is a great design for a gastropod. It doesn’t “know” this, however. All it needs to heed is a growth rule that says “keep the shape of the rim the same, but increase its circumference at a steady rate.” To make the cone curl neatly into a logarithmic spiral, just add the condition that the rate of growth is faster on one side of the rim than the other: the cone will then spiral automatically. This simple principle is sufficient to construct a vast range of different shell shapes, like those seen in different species of marine gastropods, just by varying the perimeter of the mouth of the shell.

这种逐渐扩大的边缘会产生一个圆锥体，这当然是生物的一个选择。但是为了避免负担过长的负担，圆锥体被紧凑地卷成螺旋状，这或多或少是对数螺旋壳：一种卷起的圆锥体。  
对数螺线是腹足类的一个好的设计。然而，它并不“知道”这一点。它需要注意的是一个生长规律，它说“保持轮辋的形状相同，但以稳定的速度增加它的周长”。为了使圆锥卷曲成一个对数螺旋线，只需添加一个条件，即在轮辋一侧的生长速度比另一个圆锥体更快。然后会自动旋转。这个简单的原理就足以构造一个不同的贝壳形状，就像在不同种类的海生腹足中所看到的那样，只是通过改变壳口的周长。

This prescription for growing logarithmic spirals isn’t just followed by mollusks. These pleasing forms are also found in the convolutions of animal horns, talons, and claws, although there the spirals sometimes might not even complete a single full revolution.  
Spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way often (but not always) have a logarithmic shape, at least roughly. So do cyclones, tornadoes, whirlpools, and plughole vortices. Not all vortices in fluids fit this shape, but it is a common outcome of the way fluids circulate, especially if there is a “sink” at the center, like a plughole that is removing the fluid. Why do fluids seem so readily to coordinate their movements into this tightly organized path?

这种生长对数螺旋的处方不仅仅是软体动物。这些令人愉悦的形式也存在于动物角、爪和爪的卷曲中，尽管螺旋有时甚至不可能完成一次完整的旋转。
螺旋星系如银河系通常（但不总是）有对数形状，至少粗略地。旋风、龙卷风、漩涡和螺旋桨漩涡也是如此。不是所有流体中的漩涡都符合这种形状，但它是流体循环的常见结果，特别是如果在中心有一个“汇”，就像一个移除流体的塞子。为什么看起来那么容易流体的协调动作，为这个组织严密的路径？

The organization comes from the drag that one part of a moving fluid exerts on the other parts nearby—the same force that creates eddies and wakes as a coffee spoon stirs in the cream. These mutual influences of one flow driving another give rise to feedback that can marshal small, random disturbances into coherent large-scale movements.  
The gigantic vortices of cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The preference is caused by the rotation of the Earth, a phenomenon called the Coriolis effect. Some scientists have asserted that, if you take care to let all the initial randomness in a tank of water settle down, the very small influence of the Coriolis effect creates a detectable bias in a bathtub vortex, too. But it’s not clear if this is true—the experiment is very hard to do.

这个组织来自拖曳，一个流动的流体的一部分在同一个力作用在其他部分附近，当咖啡勺在奶油中搅动时，它产生漩涡和尾迹。一个流驱动另一个流的相互影响会产生反馈，这些反馈可以将小的、随机的干扰安排成连贯的大规模运动。  
旋涡的巨大旋涡在北半球逆时针旋转，在南半球呈顺时针方向旋转。偏好是由地球的旋转引起的，这种现象被称为科里奥利效应。一些科学家已经断言，如果你小心地让水槽中的所有初始随机性稳定下来，科里奥利效应的极小影响也会在浴缸漩涡中产生可检测的偏差。但目前还不清楚这是否是真的，实验是很难做到的。

“What makes spirals so special that they recur at scales from the tiny to the cosmic?”

“是什么让他们如此特别spirals recur在宇宙尺度小到酒店？“

The secret life of plants  
Of all the patterns and forms of nature, the spiral has probably held the greatest appeal for mystics and dreamers. It is revered by adherents of “sacred geometry,” who consider the patterns and forms of nature to embody spiritual truths of the cosmos. Spirals are found in ancient and indigenous art ranging from the carvings on the Bronze Age stones of Newgrange in Ireland to the paintings of Australian Aborigines.

植物的秘密生命  
自然界的各种图案和形状，螺旋有可能举行的神秘主义者和梦想家的吸引力最大。它是被“神圣几何学的拥护者，他认为“自然的形式来体现对宇宙真理的精神。螺旋是古代和土著艺术从青铜时代石纽格兰奇爱尔兰到澳大利亚土著绘画雕刻的发现。

Nothing better exemplifies the apparent mystery and profundity of the logarithmic spiral than its manifestation on the heads of flowers such as sunflowers and daisies. The seeds of a sunflower head are arrayed in rows that trace out not just a single logarithmic spiral but two entire sets of them, rotating in opposite directions. The pattern that results has profound mathematical beauty: crystalline precision combined with organic dynamism, creating shapes that seem almost to shift as you stare at them. The same double-spiral form can be seen in other plants:  
in the leaflets of a pine cone (most easily seen by looking down at the base), the leaves twisting along the branches of a monkey-puzzle tree, the segments on the skin of a pineapple, and the florets of a Romanesco cauliflower head. All these arrangements are examples of so-called phyllotaxis, which literally means “leaf motion.” If you count the numbers of spirals in each set, you find that they only take certain values.

没有更好的体现了明显的神秘和对数螺旋线的深度比花如向日葵、雏菊的头表现。一、向日葵种子排列成行，描绘出不只是一个单一的对数螺线，但其中两全套，在相反的方向旋转。结果，有着深刻的数学美的形式：结晶精密结合有机活力，创造的形状，仿佛把你盯着他们。在其他植物中也可以看到相同的双螺旋形状：  
在松果的传单（由俯视基地最容易看到），叶片扭曲沿着一个猴谜树枝头，在菠萝皮的部分，和一个罗马花椰菜小花。所有这些安排是所谓叶序的例子，它的字面意思是“叶运动”。如果算上螺旋的数量在每一组中，你发现他们只需要一定的价值。

For pine cones, these special pairings are generally 3/5, 5/8, or 8/13. For smaller sunflowers there might be 21 spirals in one direction, 34 in the other. For very large heads, there might be as many as 144 and 233. But only these pairs of numbers—never, say, 22 and 35. Why are some of these numbers favored over others?  
Each of these pairs corresponds to two adjacent numbers in a sequence in which each number is the sum of the previous two. If we start the sequence from the smallest pairing possible (0 and 1), then it runs like this:  
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, …

Because this sequence was first written down in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, it is called the Fibonacci series. The ratio of two successive terms in the series gets ever closer to a constant value as the numbers get larger: a number called the Golden Mean, roughly 1.618.  

cones for Special pairings松，these are generally 3／5 5 / 8或8月13日。For Smaller SUNFCCC，there might be 21 spills in one direction，34 in the other .为非常严重的Heads，There might be many as 144 and 233 .But only these pairs of numbers - no，say 22 and 35 .为什么这些数字有助于其他人？
在这方面，委员会注意到，根据《公约》第四条第1款（a）项的规定，《公约》第二条第二款（a）项和（b）项所述的任何其他措施均应符合《公约》的规定。If we start the sequence from the smallest可能保留（0和1），那是一个像这样的：
0，1，1，2，3，5，8，13，21，34、55、89、144、233……  
因为这是第一个序列written down in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of比萨，known as it is called the斐波那契数列的系列。the ratio of terms in the two连续系列ever closer to得到恒定的值：get larger as the numbers number called the中庸之道，roughly 1.618。

No one is yet sure why the sunflower seeds adopt this arithmetical arrangement. One long standing idea is that it enables the florets or seeds or leaves to pack most efficiently as they bud from the tip of the growing stem. In other words, a new bud appears only when it can find enough space to do so. This is simply a geometric problem: if you want to arrange objects in an array spiraling out from a central source, what should be the angle between one object and the next? It turns out that the most efficient packing, which gives the double-spiral Fibonacci pattern of phyllotaxis, is one for which this angle is about 137.5˚—known as the Golden Angle.

That’s not the whole explanation, however. For one thing, how do plants “measure” where the next bud should go? The Fibonacci sequence and the packing idea describe how sunflower heads are arranged, but don’t explain how they achieve this arrangement. One possible explanation is that biochemical processes involving the growth hormone that triggers bud formation create what is in effect a kind of repulsive force between one bud and the next, so that the angle between them and the spiral center can’t be less than the Golden Angle.

现在还没有人知道为什么葵花籽采用算术的安排。一个长期存在的想法是，它使花或种子或树叶包最有效地为他们的芽从日益增长的茎尖。换句话说，一个新的花蕾出现时才可以找到足够的空间来做。这是一个简单的几何问题：如果你想安排对象数组中不断从一个源头，什么应该是一个对象和下一个之间的角度？事实证明，最有效的包装，这给叶序双螺旋布局模式，是指这个角度约为137.5˚-被称为黄金角。  
然而，这并不是全部的解释。一方面，植物如何“测量”下芽应该去吗？斐波那契数列和包装理念描述向日葵头设置，但没有解释他们是如何实现这一安排。一个可能的解释是，生化过程涉及生长激素触发效果一芽芽的形成创造和未来之间的一种排斥力是什么，所以他们和螺旋中心不应小于黄金角之间的角度。

An alternative theory is that the “force” that keeps buds a certain distance apart, marshaling them into the spiraling arrangements, is not chemical (caused by hormones) but mechanical:  
it comes from wrinkling and buckling of the soft tissue at the tip of the stem. At the very top of the stem, the “skin” is soft and flexible, but it gets tougher and stiffer further down the stem. The way the stem grows will compress the stiffer fabric near the tip and make it buckle. Perhaps new buds will then sprout from the crests of these wrinkles. Calculations of what this buckling looks like show that the patterns may resemble either Fibonacci spirals—little whorls of peaks around the stem’s center—or concentric, symmetrical folds on each side of the plant in alternating directions, first north–south, then east–west, and so on. That, too, is a pattern found in phyllotaxis.  

另一种理论认为，使芽保持一定距离分开的“力”使它们进入螺旋排列，不是化学（由荷尔蒙引起的）而是机械的：  
它来自于茎尖处的软组织皱褶和屈曲。在茎的顶端，“皮肤”柔软而有弹性，但在茎下更硬，更硬。茎生长的方式会压缩尖端附近的较硬的织物并使其屈曲。也许新的芽会从这些皱纹的顶部发芽。这种屈曲像表明，模式可能类似于斐波纳契数列螺旋小轮生在茎的中心或同心峰计算，对称褶皱在交替方向的植物每边，第一–南北东西，然后–，等等。这也是叶序中的一种模式。

The buckling model looks particularly appealing for explaining some of the bud arrangements in cacti, where the stubby, spiraling protrusions look more like wrinkles in hard skin. This concertinalike folding makes it easy for the soft tissues inside to swell quickly when there is water to absorb. Regular pleats and grooves are quite common on the tough outer skins of pulpy fruits such as pumpkins and gourds. These, too, may be patterns self-organized by the stresses that develop in the skin as the fruits grow and swell.  
Wrinkle patterns at the tips of our fingers can develop into spirallike concentric whorls. Because the wrinkles of fingerprints all have more or less the same width, the whorls aren’t logarithmic spirals, but more like the coil-of-rope Archimedean spiral. The buckling here seems to be caused by different layers of skin growing at different rates during early fetal development. Fingerprint whorls tend to be centered on the pads of your fingertips, where the curvature of the surface is greatest.  
But the details of the folds are determined rather randomly, and so your exact fingerprint pattern is unique. That’s so often how it is with natural patterns: they are endless variations on a theme.

屈曲模型看起来特别吸引人解释仙人掌中的一些芽排列，其中粗壮的螺旋状突起看起来更像硬皮中的皱纹。这种紧密的折叠使内部的软组织很容易在水吸收时迅速膨胀。普通的褶皱和沟槽在南瓜、葫芦等果肉坚韧的外皮上很常见。这些，也可能是自组织的发展模式，在皮肤的果实生长和膨胀应力。  
皱纹的模式在我们的指尖可以发展成螺形同心轮。因为指纹皱纹都有或多或少相同的宽度，此时不对数螺旋，但更像绳子阿基米德螺旋线圈。扣在这里似乎是由皮肤生长速率不同，在胎儿发育早期不同层引起的。指纹纹往往集中在你的指尖垫表面的曲率最大的。  
但褶皱细节确定而随机的，所以你的精确的指纹图谱是独一无二的。这常常是如何与自然模式：他们是一个主题的无限变化。

DOWN THE PLUGHOLE  
Vortex flows range in scale from the mundane spiraling of bath water as it drains to the terrifying gyrations of tornadoes and hurricanes. As a fluid flows inward toward a central core, the slightest deviation from perfect circular symmetry (which could happen at random) may be amplified because of the friction that makes one part of the flow influence another. Gradually, rotation becomes organized into a single coherent vortex. This is an example of spontaneous symmetry-breaking: the rotation transforms circular symmetry into an asymmetric twist, either clockwise or counterclockwise.
