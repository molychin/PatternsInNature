4 FLOW & CHAOS
Finding the hidden order

4流与混沌
寻找隐藏的秩序

The universe is dynamic—always on the move. From clouds of gas and dust, stars coalesce. Water circulates around the ocean in great loops and gyres,driven by differences in temperature and saltiness; convection currents stir the air and summon up clouds and jet streams. Rivers flow down from the mountains in branching formations like those through which our blood courses. Many of these flows are turbulent—too fast to maintain any constant form or to be fully predictable—and yet that doesn’t strip them of all order.  
The fundamental forms of fluid flow, such as the whirlpool vortex, are as familiar in coffee and cream as they are in a tropical cyclone; a storm in a cup, indeed. In these and other ways, patterns of flow surround us with mystery and majesty.

宇宙总是动态的。从气体和尘埃的云层中，恒星凝聚起来。水在海洋中以巨大的回路和环流循环，由温度和咸度的差异驱动；对流气流搅动空气并召唤云和急流。河流从山里流下来，就像我们血液流过的分支一样。这些流中的许多湍流太快以至于不能保持任何恒定的形式或完全可预测，但这并不能使它们全部有序。  
流体流动的基本形式，如惠而浦的旋涡，在咖啡和奶油作为他们在热带气旋一样熟悉；在杯中风暴，事实上。在这些和其他方式，流动模式围绕着我们，神秘而威严。

Rivers have always attracted artists. In China, poets of the Tang Dynasty sat contemplating them for days, while painters tried to capture the characteristic flow forms of the water in fluid brush strokes, alive with the vital energy they called qi. They were doubtless tantalized by the same thing that captivated Leonardo da Vinci when he sketched many images of flowing water in fifteenth-century Italy—the perception that amid the turbulent flow there is a kind of organization, a hint of patterns forever shifting and disintegrating. Leonardo intuited what scientists now recognize: turbulent water is not mere chaos, but a mesmerizing mixture of order and disorder. Leonardo’s intricate drawings of flow testify to his powers of observation, but there is something a little too regular about them that doesn’t quite match what we see. It is as if Leonardo felt that, in order to grasp the flow forms, he had to edit what he saw, making it more tangible and familiar. His images are what art historian Martin Kemp called structural intuitions. Through such intuitions, Kemp suggests, we try to make sense of the world we perceive. They guide us toward similarities and correspondences in the patterns of nature.

河流总是吸引着艺术家。在中国，唐代诗人坐着凝视着他们的日子，而画家试图捕获的流体的笔触的水流量特性的形式，充满生命能量的他们所谓的气。他们无疑是吸引了，迷住了达·芬奇时，他画了许多的流水意象十五世纪意大利的感知，在湍流有一种组织一样，淡淡的图案永远的转变和崩解。列奥纳多凭直觉就知道什么科学家现在认识到：湍水不仅仅是混沌的，但一个迷人的混合物的有序与无序。列奥纳多的流动复杂的图纸，证明他的观察能力，但有一点太普通人，并不完全符合我们所看到的。这是因为如果列奥纳多觉得，为了掌握流动形式，他编辑他所看到的东西，使它更加有形的和熟悉的。他的作品是艺术历史学家马亭坎普称为结构的直觉。通过这样的直觉，Kemp认为，我们试图让我们感知到的世界意义。他们引导我们走向大自然的模式的相似性和对应。

There really is a kind of order in flow, but to see it more clearly, we need to slow the flow down. Most flows in nature are turbulent: they are so swift that all that remains of this order are glimpses, mesmerizing because of their very transience. If, however, we look at much gentler flows, the patterns are obvious—and stunning.  
Think of water coursing down a long, shallow channel with smooth, flat sides. If the water’s speed is low—if it descends a very gentle gradient, say—then the flow follows more or less straight paths, as you can see by placing visible objects within it, such as a scattering of fine powder or blobs of colored ink. The water moves in flat,parallel layers, a type of flow called laminar.  
Now imagine an obstacle in the flow—a dangling branch dips into the river, a boulder on the river bed pokes up through the surface.

真的是一种为了在流，但看的更清楚，我们需要慢慢的流下来。大多数的自然流动的湍流：他们是如此的快，所有的这种秩序仍然是迷人的一瞥，因为他们非常短暂。如果，然而，我们看看更温和的流动模式是显而易见的，惊人的。  
认为水流过长，光滑的浅沟，平边。如果它是一个很温柔的梯度水的速度是低的，然后说流量或多或少遵循直线路径，你可以看到在它的可视对象，如散射细粉或一团彩色墨水。在平面，平行层水动，一种流动称为层流。  
现在想象在圆晃来晃去的分支入河的一个障碍，在河床上boulder戳通过表面。


FOOTSTEPS IN THE FLOW  
As a water strider paces across the surface of water, held up by surface tension, it leaves an ornate wake behind it, each step dragging the water into pairs of oppositely rotating vortices that evolve with baroque elegance (revealed here with blue dye).

2 and 3 STUDIES OF FLOWING WATER  
Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of flowing water came from many hours of careful observation, and show the artist’s determination to discover the “essential forms” behind the superficial appearance of disorder.

流动水的2和3研究  
达·芬奇的小品流水来自许多小时的仔细观察，表现出艺术家的发现“基本形式”的表象背后，测定障碍。


How does it disturb the smooth laminar flow?  
That depends on several things: the size of the obstacle, the viscosity of the liquid (water and syrup respond differently), and in particular the speed of the flow. If it is slow enough, the fluid may pass gently around the obstacle and come together again on the far side, so that the paths revealed by the tracer material—the powder or ink—are smoothly bent to either side before becoming parallel again. But if the flow is a little faster, a pair of spinning eddies appears in the wake behind the obstacle. Faster still, and the wake develops a persistent wavy undulation. As the flow speed increases, these waves grow and acquire crests that “break” and curl over, twisting into a regular train of vortices that turn first one way and then the other.

它是如何影响平滑层流？  
这取决于几个方面：障碍物的大小、液体的粘度（水和糖浆的反应不同），并在特定的流动速度。如果它足够慢，流体可以通过轻轻地绕过障碍，再次走到一起，在另一边，这样通过示踪材料粉末或墨水显示路径平滑地弯曲一侧前再次平行。但如果流动快一点，一对旋转的漩涡出现在障碍物后面的尾。速度更快，和唤醒的发展持续的波状起伏。随着流速的增加，这些波的波峰，成长和获得“打破”和卷曲，扭曲成一个定期列车的涡流，把第一个方法然后其他。

This baroque pattern is known as a Kármán vortex street. The vortices spring from the sides of the obstacle itself, as the fluid flowing past is dragged inward by friction and begins to turn on itself. Vortex streets are common in the natural world. They can be seen in cloud formations as air streams past some disrupting influence such as a region of high pressure. They spring from the moving feet of a water strider propped up by surface tension on a pond surface, and they are shed by the flapping wings of insects, which cleverly maneuver the wings so as to harvest a little push from the eddies to give them extra lift.

这baroque pattern也被称为KáRMáN涡街。的vortices春面obstacle itself能力，为流体流动过去也dragged向内by friction和开始在itself掉头。涡的街道是常见的在自然世界。他们可以看到在云formations级空气流过去的一些disrupting influence这样一个年代的地区的高压力。他们从春
“移动脚的水strider propped起来by surface tension在池塘的表面，和他们的棚是由flapping翅膀的insects，这cleverly maneuver的翅膀，所以航班到收获的小推从eddies给他们额外的电梯。

The growth of wavy patterns in smooth laminar flow is said to be a kind of flow instability:  
it signals the onset of the less regular and more turbulent motion that will appear at still greater flow speeds. Something similar can be found when two layers of fluid move past each other in opposite directions, or more generally,when they move at different speeds, so that one drags against the other. This situation is called a shear flow, and again it is ubiquitous in nature, especially in the atmospheric flows of our planet and others, such as the swirling gaseous atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. The wavy disturbance is self-amplifying: as soon as it appears, it has a tendency to grow, the waves deepening and sharpening. This self-amplification is a common condition of pattern formation.

在平稳的层流波浪模式的生长被认为是一种流动的不稳定性：  
它的信号的不规则运动，会出现更大的流动速度和湍流的发生。类似的事情时可以发现两层流体移动过去彼此相反的方向，或更一般地，当他们移动的速度不同，所以，一个将对其他。这种情况被称为剪切流动，这又是普遍存在的在自然界中，尤其是在我们的星球和其他大气流动，如旋转的气体Jupiter和萨图恩。波状扰动是自我放大：当它出现时，它有增长的趋势，波浪的深化和锐化。这是一个自我放大模式形成的一般条件。

Finding order in chaos  
Jupiter’s atmosphere is turbulent. Aside from the parallel bands called zonal jets, the flows are fast enough to wash away any truly regular pattern, and the shapes and forms of the vortices are constantly changing and shifting. Yet the flow doesn’t look simply random: there is a kind of elegant beauty to it, punctuated as it is with pockets of organized motion. The famous Great Red Spot is the most prominent: an enormous storm with winds of up to 350 miles an hour, which has been raging for at least two centuries, possibly several more. Smaller vortices come and go, some lasting decades before they are dissipated or swallowed.  
That’s just how it is with turbulence: it might not have a pattern in the usual sense but, like the branches of a tree or the ever-diminishing echoes of a fractal, it seems to hint at some deep structure beyond bewildering chaos. Can we make this impression more precise? Can we describe the shapes of turbulence?

混沌中的秩序  
木星的大气是湍流的。除了平行带称为纬向射流外，水流足够快，可以冲走任何规则的模式，旋涡的形状和形式也在不断变化和变化。然而，这种流动并不是简单随意的：它有一种优雅的美，有点像有组织的运动口袋。著名的大人物红斑是最突出的：一场风速达350英里每小时的巨大风暴，已经持续了至少两个世纪，可能还有几次。更小的旋涡来来去去，有的持续几十年才被消耗或吞噬。  
这只是它是如何与动荡：它可能没有通常意义上的模式，但是，像一棵树或不断减少的分形与分支，它似乎暗示了一些深层结构超越困惑的混乱。我们能让这个印象更精确吗？我们可以描述湍流的形状？

Scientists have studied turbulent flow for hundreds of years, and yet still they cannot claim to fully understand it. It’s one thing to have the right equations that describe the motion, but quite another to solve them. The basic challenge of fluid flow, especially with turbulence, is that everything seems to affect everything else. This acute sensitivity of the flow to every tiny nuance makes the situation chaotic: it becomes impossible to predict, by looking at the flow pattern at one point in time, how it will look at a later stage.  
Given this unpredictability, can we hope to say anything at all about the “shape of turbulence”?  
Yes, we can. Even if we can’t predict exactly what a particular flow will look like, we might say something about its average properties.

科学家们已经研究了几百年的湍流，但他们仍然不能声称完全理解它。用正确的方程描述运动是一回事，但解决它们又是另一回事。流体流动的基本挑战，特别是湍流，是一切似乎都会影响其他一切。这种流动对每一个细微细微差别的敏锐敏感性使情况变得混乱：通过观察一个时间点的流动模式，它无法预测未来阶段的情况。  
鉴于这种不可预测性，我们是否希望对“湍流的形状”有任何发言权？  
是的，我们可以。即使我们不能准确地预测一个特定的流将是什么样子，我们可以说一些关于它的平均性质。

One of the first people to make headway with this question was Lewis Fry Richardson, the mathematician who first discerned the general concept of what we now call fractal structure.  
Richardson was interested in turbulent flow partly because he was working on weather prediction,and he suggested that it might be imagined as a “cascade” in which the energy of the moving fluid is passed down from large eddies to ever smaller ones, until finally it gets dissipated as heat in the random motions of the fluid molecules. It was later shown that this energy cascade obeys a mathematical law in which the amount of energy bound up in eddies of a particular size is related to that size via a rather simple equation.

在这个问题上取得进展的第一人是Lewis Fry Richardson，数学家谁首先发现了我们现在所称的分形结构的一般概念。  
理查德森是在湍流中感兴趣的部分原因是因为他工作上的天气预报，他建议，可以想象为“级联”的运动流体的能量通过从大涡越来越小的，直到最后它得到热在消散E液体分子的随机运动。后来证明，这个能量级串服从一个数学定律，能量束缚在一个特定大小的涡量大小有关，通过一个相当简单的方程。

As with fractals themselves, this mathematical law encodes a kind of “hidden regularity” among the apparent disorder—a cryptic pattern, if you like.  
The basic idea seems sound, although there are still debates about, for example, how quickly (if at all) a turbulent flow can be restored to a more orderly state, or whether there is more than one type of turbulence.

随着分形本身，这个数学规律编码一种“潜规律”的明显障碍神秘的模式中，如果你喜欢。  
基本的想法似乎是合理的，尽管仍有争论，例如，如何快速（如果有的话）湍流可以恢复到一个更为有序的状态，或者是否有一种以上的湍流。

Turning over  
The Earth’s atmosphere is never still. Air is always on the move somewhere as winds bear it from regions of high to low pressure. But the cause of this flow is, at root, not so much variations in pressure as in temperature. Close to the surface,heat radiating from the land or sea warms the air, and as it heats up it expands and becomes less dense. This gives it buoyancy, and it rises.  
Higher in the atmosphere it cools again, becomes more dense, and sinks. This rising of warm, less dense air and sinking of cool, denser air is called convection. It doesn’t happen at random, but is organized into three vast conveyors in each hemisphere—belts parallel to the equator in which air rises along one edge and sinks along the other. They carry heat and moisture with them,governing the climate regimes of the planet.

翻车  
地球的大气层永远不会静止。空气总是在移动，风住了从高到低压力区。但这个流程的原因，根本没有那么多的压力变化和温度。接近地表，从陆地或海洋温暖的空气散热，当它升温膨胀，密度变小。这使它浮力上升。  
高等大气中冷却了，变得更致密，汇。这种上升的温暖，密度较小的空气下沉的凉爽，稠密的空气称为对流。这并不偶然，而是分为三个巨大的传送带在每个半球带平行，空气上升沿一个边汇沿其他赤道。它们携带热量和水分，统治地球的气候制度。

Convective flow often adopts states of patterned self-organization. Imagine a shallow layer of water heated in a pan. The warm liquid on the bottom is buoyant and “wants” to rise—but how is it to get past the denser liquid above? The answer is that there is spontaneous symmetrybreaking: the uniform layers of liquid break up into circulating cells of more or less regular shapes,with the warm liquid rising in some parts and cooler liquid sinking in others. Some of these patterns can become astonishingly well ordered. In the atmosphere, their shapes can impose order on the clouds, creating the parallel stripes of “cloud streets,” sometimes called a mackerel sky because of its resemblance to the striped markings of those fish. Even the ferocious convection on the Sun doesn’t just result in disarray. The Sun’s surface is covered with so-called “solar-granules,“ patches that are darker at the edges than in the middle, and which change and shift every few minutes.

对流常采用图案化自组织状态。想象一个浅层的水在锅里加热。底部的温热液体是浮力的，“想要”上升，但是它是如何通过上面的稠密液体的呢？答案是，有自发的对称破缺：均匀的液体层分裂成循环形状的或多或少的规则形状的细胞，暖液体在某些部位上升，冷却器液体在其他部分下沉。这些模式中的一些可以变得令人惊讶地井井有条。在大气中，它们的形状可以在云层上施加秩序，产生平行的“云街”条纹，有时被称为鲭鱼天空，因为它与条纹条纹的鱼相似。即使是在太阳上的猛烈对流也不只是导致混乱。太阳表面覆盖着所谓的“太阳颗粒”，在边缘比中间更暗，每隔几分钟变化一次。


3 SUNSPOT  
Even the seething surface of the Sun is patterned.Convection in the hot plasma creates this “granulated” structure of bright spots in a web of slightly dimmer (cooler) regions. The black structure in the center is a sunspot, which is even cooler still.

即使是炽热的太阳表面也被图案化。热等离子体中的对流在轻微变暗（凉爽）区域的网状物中产生这种“粒状”结构。中心的黑色结构是太阳黑子，甚至更冷。

Flocking and swarming  
As dusk dims the fall sky, starlings gather and flock in search of a place to roost. They are looking for woodlands, buildings, piers, and reed beds where they can find shelter from harsh weather and predators. The flock might swell to many thousands—even hundreds of thousands—of birds, and as it grows it displays one of the most astonishing sights in nature. Twisting and turning, shifting from near transparent to opaque as the angles of the birds’ bodies change in our line of sight, the flock becomes a so-called “murmuration” in which these creatures seem to have acquired a group mind as they maneuver in unison.

群集蜂群  
黄昏时分，黄昏时分，椋鸟聚集在一起寻找栖息之地。他们正在寻找林地、建筑物、码头和芦苇床，在那里可以找到严酷的天气和掠食者的避难所。成群的鸟可能会成千上千只甚至成百上千只鸟，随着它的生长，它展现出自然界中最令人惊叹的景象之一。随着鸟类身体的角度在我们的视线中变化，扭转和转动，从接近透明变为不透明，羊群变成所谓的“喃喃”，这些生物在它们一致行动的时候，似乎已经获得了群体思维。


How do they do it? All it takes is for each bird to observe some rather simple rules of motion. They avoid crashing into each other or getting too close. They try to match their direction of movement to the average direction of their neighbors. And they try not to drift too far apart. A bird in one part of the flock has not the slightest idea of what others far away are doing; it is merely attentive to those close by.  
The same sort of behavior can be seen in schooling fish and swarming locusts or bats. The coherent movements are very effective at communicating information fast: waves can ripple quickly through the crowd, so that the alarm signs of an approaching predator are rapidly sent to fish far from the danger spot.

他们是怎么做到的？每一只鸟都需要观察一些简单的运动规律。他们避免撞到对方或太接近。他们试图将他们的移动方向与邻居的平均方向相匹配。他们尽量不分开太远。一只鸟在羊群的一部分，丝毫不知道远处的其他人在做什么，它只关心身边的人。  
同样的行为可以在学校的鱼和蜂拥的蝗虫或蝙蝠身上看到。连贯的动作非常有效。  
在快速传播信息的过程中，海浪可以很快地在人群中传播，从而使接近捕食者的警报信号迅速地被送到远离危险点的鱼身上。
