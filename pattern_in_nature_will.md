MICROSCOPIC HONEYCOMBS OF THE SEA
The complex, perforated exoskeletons of radiolarians are like “frozen foams”: they are made by the crystallization of a hard mineral at the junctions between bubblelike vesicles that are temporarily formed as the structure is deposited.
It’s no surprise, then, that they observe some of the “rules” of bubble layers, forming a roughly hexagonal arrangement in which the edges join in threes at approximately 120˚.
These basic principles are elaborated in many different ways in different species. Radiolarians like this are typically about 0.1–0.2 mm wide.
海洋微蜂窝
放射虫的复杂、穿孔的外骨骼就像“冻结的泡沫”：它们是在一个坚硬的矿物的结晶过程中形成的，在结构沉积时暂时形成的泡状囊泡之间的连接处。
这并不奇怪，他们观察到气泡层的一些“规则”，形成一个大致六边形的排列，其中边缘以120的距离连接在三个。
这些基本原理在不同物种中以许多不同的方式阐述。像这样的放射虫通常大约0.1到0.2毫米宽。


MAKING USE OF BUBBLES
Bubbles and foams are put to use in nature. Here the common purple snail (Janthina janthina) hangs onto the surface of the sea from a buoyant raft made of bubbles coated with mucus. This enables the snail to feed on small creatures that live at the water’s surface.
利用泡沫
气泡和泡沫在自然界中被使用。在这里，普通的紫色蜗牛（JANTYNA JANTINA）悬挂在海面上，由一个浮力筏制成，上面覆盖着粘液的气泡。这使得蜗牛可以吃生活在水面上的小生物。



STRUCTURAL COLOR
Tiny parallel ridges on the surfaces of the scales of butterfly wings cause interference in the reflected light that picks out certain colors—in
other words, some of these colors (particularly the iridescent blues and greens) are made not by light-absorbing pigments but by light-scattering structural patterns.
However, even closer inspection of the wing scales of some butterfly species shows a still finer and more intricate structure, as we will see
on the next page.
结构色彩
蝴蝶翅膀鳞片表面的微小平行脊会在反射光中干扰，从而吸收某些颜色。
换句话说，这些颜色中的一些（特别是虹彩蓝调和绿色）不是由光吸收颜料而是由光散射结构图案制成。
然而，对一些蝴蝶种类的翅膀鳞片的更仔细的检查显示出一个更精细和更复杂的结构，正如我们将在下一页看到的。


BUTTERFLY FOAM
These cross-sections of the wing scales of the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) show that the fabric, made from the glucose-based material chitin, is perforated with an ordered, threedimensional labyrinth of channels that has the same structure as a mathematical “periodic minimal surface” known as a gyroid. It is thought to be formed on a foamlike template made of soft membrane. The structure is strong and lightweight, but its key function is to cause interference of the reflected light rays so as to make the wing scales appear green.
蝶形泡沫
这些绿鳞蝶（Callophrys rubi）翅鳞片的横截面表明，由基于葡萄糖的材料甲壳素制成的织物被穿孔，其具有与数学“周期最小冲浪相同的结构”的有序的三维迷宫。“被称为陀螺状”。它被认为是在由软薄膜制成的泡沫状模板上形成的。结构坚固，重量轻，但其主要作用是引起反射光线的干涉，使机翼鳞片呈现绿色。




MINERAL MESH
The filigree porous skeletons of sponges, such as this Venus’s flower basket, are made from spines or “spicules” of glasslike material woven together.
矿物筛网
海绵的丝状多孔骨架，如维纳斯的花篮，是由棘状或类似于玻璃状物质的“针状物”编织而成的。



SEA SCULPTURES
Many marine organisms, including coccolithophores (1), diatoms (2 and 4), and dinoflagelletes (3), have hard exoskeleton shells that are delicately patterned, often with a porous, foamlike appearance. While it seems likely that they, too, are created by the deposition of a hard mineral on a template of soft organic material, the details of this process are in many cases not fully understood.
海雕
许多海洋生物，包括颗石藻（1）、硅藻（2和4）和甲藻（3），具有坚硬的外骨骼壳，它们被精细地图案化，通常具有多孔的、泡沫状的外观。虽然它们也可能是由硬矿物在软有机材料模板上沉积而形成的，但在许多情况下，这种过程的细节还没有完全理解。


KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
The sea urchin Cidaris rugosa defends itself with an armor cladding of spines, made from hard calcium carbonate patterned with intricate textures. This patterning continues down to the microscopic scale,where the mineral turns out to have the ordered, porous structure shown below.
保持距离
海胆Cidaris rugosa用盔甲包裹自己，由坚硬的碳酸钙制成，纹理复杂。这种图样继续向下延伸到微观尺度，其中矿物呈现出有序的多孔结构，如下所示。




BUBBLE VISION
The compound eyes of insects are packed hexagonally, just like the bubbles of a bubble raft—although, in fact, each facet is a lens connected to a long, thin, retinal cell beneath. The structures that are formed by clusters of biological cells often have forms governed by much the same rules as foams and bubble rafts—for example, just three cell walls meet at any vertex. The microscopic structure of the facets of a fly’s eye—beyond what is visible here—supplies one of the best examples. Each facet contains a cluster of four light-sensitive cells that have the same shape as a cluster of four ordinary bubbles.
气泡视觉
昆虫的复眼被包装成六角形，就像泡筏的气泡一样，事实上，每个小面都是一个透镜，连接在下面的一个又长又薄的视网膜细胞上。由生物细胞团形成的结构通常具有由与泡沫和气泡筏相同的规则所支配的形式，例如，只有三个细胞壁在任何顶点相遇。苍蝇眼的微观结构超出了这里所能看到的，这是最好的例子之一。每个小面都包含一组四个感光细胞，它们的形状与四个普通气泡的形状相同。





SHAPING A DROPLET
When water sits on a water-repellent surface, it may break up into droplets. The shapes of these drops are governed by surface tension, which pulls them into roughly spherical shapes, as well as by gravity (which will flatten a droplet on a horizontal surface) and the forces that act between the water and the underlying surface. If those latter forces are strong enough, the droplets are pulled into lens-shaped pancakes. And if the surface isn’t strongly water-repellent, the droplets may spread out into a flat, smooth film.
形成液滴
当水在防水表面上时，它可能分解成液滴。这些液滴的形状受表面张力的支配，表面张力将它们拉成大致球形的形状，以及重力（这将使水平表面上的液滴变平）和作用在水和下表面之间的力。如果后一种作用力足够强，液滴就会被拉成透镜状的煎饼。如果表面没有强烈的防水性，水滴可能会扩散到平坦光滑的薄膜中。




7 ARRAYS & TILINGS
Why crystals aren’t fve-sided—and how to make impossible ones that are
阵列与倾斜
为什么晶体不是边缘的，如何制造不可能的


Some early philosophers suspected that the world was, at root, geometric:
built by God according to simple mathematical rules. It was an understandable assumption if you think about crystals—the very stuff of the earth—with their orderly, faceted shapes. Miners and explorers of underground caverns could find themselves in a geometric universe, where all around nature was organized into glittering mathematical perfection. Wasn’t this evidence of nature’s fundamental order imprinting itself on matter?
一些早期哲学家怀疑这个世界是根深蒂固的几何：
由上帝根据简单的数学规则建造的。这是一个可以理解的假设，如果你认为水晶是地球上非常有序的、有刻面的形状的东西。地下洞窟的矿工和探险家们可以发现自己处于一个几何的宇宙中，周围的自然界被组织成闪闪发光的数学完美。这难道不是自然界的基本秩序在物质上烙印的证据吗？


CRYSTAL TAPESTRY

氯化镁晶体，偏振光下可见。

In the early seventeenth century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler wondered if there was a more tangible reason than God’s will for the shapes of crystals. In particular, he asked why snowflakes always have six points. He knew that if cannonballs are stacked compactly together, each ball is surrounded by six others at the corners of a hexagon. Might the sixfold symmetry of the icy snowflake come from the stacking of “globules” of frozen water?
十七世纪初，德国天文学家开普勒想知道是否有比水晶意志更真实的原因。特别是，他问雪花为什么总是有六点。他知道如果炮弹紧紧地堆积在一起，每个球在六边形的角上被六个球包围。冰雪的六重对称性是否来自冰冻水的“小球”堆积？

Kepler never got to the bottom of the snowflake problem—that took another four centuries. But his intuition about the cause of crystals’ regularity was right. The eighteenth century French priest and botanist René Just Haüy figured that crystal shapes are indeed dictated by the arrangements of their atoms. In his book on mineralogy in 1801—the founding text of the science of crystallography—Haüy showed how atom-stacking produces facets rather like the triangular faces of an ancient stepped pyramid.
Because of this atomic-scale structure, the shapes of crystals often echo those of the smallest repeating cluster of atoms in the crystal lattice. For ordinary rock salt (sodium chloride) this cluster is cube-shaped, and so are the crystals—as you can see by looking at table salt under a microscope.
开普勒从来没有到达雪花问题的底部，又花了四个世纪。但是他对晶体规律性原因的直觉是正确的。十八世纪的法国牧师和植物学家仁埃尔只是哈伊认为晶体的形状确实是由原子的排列决定的。在他的1801年的矿物学著作《晶体学》的创刊中，Huy展示了原子堆积是如何产生面的，就像古阶梯金字塔的三角面一样。
由于这种原子尺度结构，晶体的形状常常与晶格中最小的原子簇重复。对于普通岩盐（氯化钠），这个簇是立方体形状的，晶体也可以通过显微镜下观察食盐来观察。

Calcite, a mineral form of the compound calcium carbonate, has rhombus-shaped facets because that, too, is how the atomic building blocks
are arranged. These crystal shapes, or so-called “habits,” of minerals are diverse and beautiful, but all in some way bear the imprint, at scales we can see and touch, of the arrangements of the atoms that constitute them.
These crystal structures can be classified by their symmetry properties, just like the forms we looked at in Chapter 1—whether they can be rotated or reflected, say, to leave their appearance unchanged. There are only a fixed number of ways of arranging objects so that they will repeat again and again in perfect array. Each of these distinct repeating patterns is called a group, because it has an associated group of symmetry operations.
方解石是复合碳酸钙的一种矿物形式，具有菱形晶面，因为这也是原子块的排列方式。这些晶体的形状，或者所谓的“习惯”矿物是多样的和美丽的，但在某种程度上，它们承载着我们能看见和触摸的组成原子的排列的印记。
这些晶体结构可以根据它们的对称性质来分类，就像我们在第一章中看到的那样，它们是否可以被旋转或反射，比如说，使它们的外观不变。排列物体的方式只有固定的数量，所以它们会以完美的排列一次又一次地重复。这些不同的重复模式被称为一组，因为它有一组相关联的对称操作。

In two dimensions, for example, we can pack together squares, hexagons, and equilateral triangles this way into “tiling” patterns. If the tiles
are not regular polygons of this sort—if they are rectangles, say, like the arrangement of bricks in a wall—then there are other tiling groups, too.
There are precisely 17 of these two-dimensional “wallpaper” groups, many of which have been used in decorative schemes for walls and floors by various cultures since ancient times.
Crystals are made by stacking atoms in three dimensions. In this case, there are 230 symmetry groups (called space groups): 230 different ways of arranging objects into regular 3-D arrays. All crystals must belong to one of these groups—otherwise they couldn’t be true crystals, because they wouldn’t be made up of elements whose arrangement repeats again and again. (As we’ll see, though, this depends on how you want to define a crystal.)
例如，在两个维度中，我们可以将正方形、六边形和等边三角形以这种方式打包成“平铺”图案。如果砖块不是矩形的，如果它们是矩形，比如墙中砖的排列，那么也有其他瓷砖组。
有17个这样的二维“壁纸”群体，其中许多已经被用来装饰墙壁和地板的各种文化自古以来。
晶体是由原子在三个维度上堆积而成的。在这种情况下，有230个对称群（称为空间群）：将对象排列成规则的3-D阵列的230种不同方式。所有晶体都必须属于这些基团中的一个，否则它们不可能是真正的晶体，因为它们不会由排列重复的元素构成。（正如我们将看到的，这取决于你想要如何定义一个水晶。）

The simplest crystals, such as metals, are made of identical atoms. Since all the atoms are the same size, they can be efficiently packed together into hexagonal arrays, like the cannonball piles noted by Kepler. This is the densest possible way to stack spheres—a fact proved only in 1994—and it is called hexagonal close-packing. It has only about 25 percent empty space between the spheres. Some metals, such as iron, chromium, and tungsten, instead adopt a so-called “bodycentered cubic lattice”, in which the repeating unit consists of eight atoms at the corners of a cube and one in the middle. For cannonballlike spheres, this has 32 percent empty space. In diamonds,carbon atoms are packed into repeating patterns of eight atoms, again with a cubic shape, which for spheres leaves as much as 66 percent of the space empty. For crystals containing several or many different types of atoms, the atomic-scale structures can get pretty complicated, but the repeating patterns still have to correspond to one of the 230 space groups.
最简单的晶体，如金属，是由相同的原子构成的。因为所有的原子都是相同的大小，所以它们可以被有效地包装成六角形的阵列，就像开普勒所指出的炮弹堆一样。这是堆积球体的最密集的方法——事实证明只有在1994，它被称为六边形密堆积。球体之间只有约25%的空隙。一些金属，如铁、铬和钨，则采用所谓的“体心立方晶格”，其中重复单元由立方体的角上的八个原子和中间的一个组成。对于炮弹状的球体，它有32%个空的空间。在钻石中，碳原子被包装成八个原子的重复图案，再次呈立方形状，其中球体留下的空隙多达66%。对于含有多种或多种不同类型原子的晶体，原子尺度结构可能变得相当复杂，但重复的模式仍然必须对应于230个空间群中的一个。
The interference between X-rays bouncing off regular arrays of atoms and molecules produces a pattern of bright spots in the scattered beam from which the positions of the atoms can be deduced. This technique, called X-ray crystallography, was first used in the early twentieth century to deduce the crystal structures of simple minerals, but from the middle of the century it began to reveal the atomic structures of complex biological molecules such as proteins, enabling scientists to understand how life works at the molecular scale. In 1953 X-ray crystallography was used to study the crystals formed by DNA, and thereby to show that this vital biomolecule has its famous double-helix structure.
When a crystal melts to a liquid, it loses its atomic-scale order; there is no longer any regularly repeating array. However, some substances can melt in one direction while remaining ordered in others. In particular, some long, rod-shaped molecules may form liquids that flow, even though the molecules stay lined up roughly parallel to each other, a little like logs floating on a river. These are liquid crystals. In some liquid crystals the aligned molecules stack up in regularly spaced layers even though, within a given layer,the molecules move around and jostle like people in a crowd. The alignment of molecules in liquid crystals can make them scatter polarized light into spectacular patterns, from which it is possible to deduce something about the molecular order that the liquid crystal contains.
X射线在原子和分子的规则阵列上的碰撞产生散射光束中的亮点，由此可以推断出原子的位置。这种技术被称为X射线晶体学，最早在二十世纪初被用来推断简单矿物的晶体结构，但从本世纪中期开始，它揭示了诸如蛋白质等复杂生物分子的原子结构，从而使科学家们得以研究。坚持生命如何在分子尺度上运转。在1953，X射线晶体学被用来研究由DNA形成的晶体，从而表明这个重要的生物分子具有其著名的双螺旋结构。
当晶体熔化成液体时，它失去了原子级的顺序，不再有规则的重复排列。然而，一些物质可以在一个方向上熔化，而其余的则是有序的。特别是，一些长而杆状的分子可以形成流动的液体，即使分子大致平行地排列在一起，有点像漂浮在河上的原木。这些是液晶。在一些液晶中，排列的分子堆积在规则间隔的层中，即使在给定的层内，分子像一群人一样在周围移动和挤挤。液晶分子的排列可以使偏振光散射成壮观的图案，由此可以推断出液晶分子的分子有序性。


1 GROWING ICE
Ice crystals, like these on a window in winter, can grow into beautiful and complex branched shapes in a process called dendritic growth. The same process creates the shape of snowflakes.
1生长冰
冰晶，就像冬天窗户上的冰晶，在一种叫做树枝状生长的过程中，可以成长为美丽而复杂的分支形状。同样的过程会产生雪花的形状。

2 STAR QUALITY
Snowflakes display sixfold (hexagonal) symmetry.
This reflects the hexagonal arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal, translated to a scale that can be seen (just) with the naked eye—but also elaborated into exotic patterns by the growth process of the flakes.

MINERAL LANDSCAPES
Crystals may form complex structures and patterns over many different size scales, from the atomic level up, as seen in this sample of the mineral sphalerite (zinc sulfide).
晶体可以在许多不同的尺度上形成复杂的结构和图案，从原子水平上看，如矿物闪锌矿（硫化锌）的样品中所见。


The law of tiling, and how to break it The patterns of crystalline lattices are governed by strict geometrical rules that “forbid” certain types of symmetry. For the 17 two-dimensional tiling patterns, for example, the tiles can have the same symmetry as squares, rectangles, hexagons,rhombi, or triangles. You can rotate the pattern symmetrically by half a full revolution (for rhombic or rectangular tiles), or a quarter, a third, or a sixth—but not a fifth. There are no tile shapes that can be fitted together perfectly, with no gaps,to create a tiling lattice with fivefold symmetry:
瓷砖的规律，以及如何打破它的晶体晶格的模式是严格的几何规则，“禁止”某些类型的对称性。对于17个二维拼接图案，例如，瓦片可以具有与正方形、矩形、六边形、菱形或三角形相同的对称性。你可以通过半个完整的旋转（菱形或矩形瓦片），或四分之一，第三，第六，而不是第五的方式对称地旋转图案。没有瓷砖形状可以完美地配合在一起，没有缝隙，形成一个五重对称的瓷砖格子：

you can’t tile pentagons perfectly. The same is true for all tiles with more than sixfold symmetry (sevenfold, eightfold, and so on). This applies to 3-D space groups, too: you can’t make an orderly framework in three dimensions from units with fivefold symmetry. This might seem unfair on the pentagon, but it’s just a fact of basic geometry.
At least, so we thought until three decades ago, when a material that seemed to be crystalline was found to have one of these “forbidden” symmetries. In 1984, researchers working in the USA discovered an alloy of aluminum and the metal manganese that, according to X-ray crystallography, seemed to have tenfold crystal symmetry: X-rays bounced off this material to produce rings of ten equally spaced spots. That seemed to imply a crystal lattice with tenfold (or fivefold) symmetry, which was impossible according to the laws of geometry. What was going on?
你不能完美地瓦解五边形。对于具有六倍对称性的所有瓦片（七倍，八倍，等等）也是如此。这也适用于3-D空间组：你不能在三个维度上从五重对称的单元中形成有序的框架。这在五角大楼看来是不公平的，但这只是一个基本几何学的事实。
至少，我们认为，直到三年前，当一个似乎是晶体的材料被发现有一个“禁止”对称。1984，在美国工作的研究人员发现了一种铝和金属锰的合金，根据X射线晶体学，它们似乎具有十倍的晶体对称性：X射线从这一材料反弹出来，产生十个等间距的斑点。这似乎意味着一个具有十倍（或五倍）对称性的晶格，这是不可能的几何定律。发生了什么事？

This material was the first so-called “quasicrystal.” Over the following decade or so, scientists realized that it is possible to organize atoms into patterns with fivefold (and eightfold, tenfold, and twelvefold) symmetry that don’t quite repeat exactly, as crystals were known to do.
These patterns look at a casual glance as though they are pentagonlike lattices, but every so often the pattern slips, so that it is never possible to rotate or move it in a way that superimposes it exactly on itself. Despite this lack of perfect regularity and order, the pattern (when built from atoms) is orderly enough to produce bright spots in the reflected X-rays. The International Union of Crystallography has, in fact, now broadened the very definition of a crystal so that it can include quasicrystals.
这种材料是第一个所谓的“准晶”。在接下来的十年左右，科学家们认识到，有可能把原子组织成五倍（和八倍、十倍、十二倍）对称的图案，它们不象晶体一样被精确地重复。
这些模式看起来是偶然的一瞥，好像它们是五边形的格，但是图案经常滑动，所以它永远不可能旋转或移动它，使它完全叠加在自己身上。尽管缺乏完美的规律性和有序性，图案（当由原子构建时）是有序的，足以在反射的X射线中产生亮点。事实上，国际晶体学联合会扩大了对晶体的定义，使它可以包括准晶。

The easiest way to understand quasicrystal patterns is again to think of tilings in two dimensions, although the actual crystals are threedimensional. You can’t tile pentagons, but in the 1970s the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose discovered a set of two rhombus-shaped tiles that can be fitted together without gaps to create a lattice filled with fivefold symmetric shapes:
five-pointed stars and decagons, for example.
了解准晶体模式最简单的方法是重新考虑两个维度的倾斜，尽管实际晶体是三维的。你不能瓦解五边形，但在20世纪70年代，数学物理学家罗杰·彭罗斯发现了一组两个菱形瓦片，它们可以在没有间隙的情况下装配在一起，形成一个充满五重对称形状的格子：
例如，五尖星和十面格。

This tiling never quite repeats its pattern exactly, but if it is built up while applying a few simple rules about which tile can lie next to which, it can be extended forever. If you imagine putting an atom at the corner of each tile (or the equivalent rhomboids in three dimensions), you end up with an array that appears to be very much like the atomic lattice of a quasicrystal.
Such patterns, which seem to bend the rules of geometry, were already known to Islamic artists hundreds of years ago, who explored them in complex designs and mosaic tilings. Both because of religious restrictions on depictions of the natural world and because Islamic philosophers were deeply interested in mathematics, these tiling patterns were developed into a highly sophisticated art that can be found decorating shrines, mosques, and palaces throughout the Islamic world. One design on the Darb-i-Imam shrine in Isfahan, Iran, made in 1453, is almost identical to a Penrose tiling, with its mesmeric, never-quite-repeating pattern. The tiling patterns were constructed from conceptual building blocks called girih according to strict assembly rules similar (but not identical) to those used to make Penrose tilings.
这个瓷砖从来没有完全重复它的模式，但如果它是建立在应用几个简单的规则，哪些瓦可以躺在旁边，它可以永远延伸。如果你想象把原子放在每个瓦片的角上（或者在三个维度上等效的菱形），你就会得到一个看起来非常像准晶的原子晶格的数组。
这些图案，似乎弯曲几何规则，已经知道数百年前伊斯兰艺术家，谁探索他们在复杂的设计和马赛克倾斜。两者都是因为对自然世界的宗教限制，因为伊斯兰教哲学家对数学非常感兴趣，这些瓷砖图案被发展成一种高度复杂的艺术，可以在整个伊斯兰世界中装饰神龛、清真寺和宫殿。RLD。在伊朗伊斯法罕的DARB-IMAM神殿的一个设计，在1453，几乎是相同的彭罗斯瓷砖，其催眠，从来没有重复模式。根据GeIIH的概念构建块，根据严格的装配规则构造了拼接图案，这些规则与（Penrose tilings）的组装规则相似（但不完全相同）。


LIQUID CRYSTALS
These crystals have a liquidlike ordering of their molecules in one or two directions,while being disorderly and liquidlike in the others. The molecular arrangements can twist polarized light, resulting in these colorful textures when seen under a polarizedlight microscope.
液晶
这些晶体在一个或两个方向上具有液态的有序排列，而其它晶体则是无序的和液态的。分子排列可以扭转偏振光，在偏振光显微镜下看到这些彩色纹理。


Flowers of ice
Snowfl akes show the pattern-forming potential of crystals at its most exuberant. While Kepler guessed at the underlying reason for the geometric  regularity of crystals, in the snowfl ake this orderliness is taken to kaleidoscopic extremes,creating shapes in which the symmetry of the hexagon is embellished almost to an absurd degree. If the packing together of atoms and molecules generates blocky facets, why then do these ice crystals take on such delicate and ornate shapes?
Some snowfl akes are fancier than others. The spectacular frondlike fl akes commonly shown in snowfl ake pictures are usually cherry-picked from among less-perfectly symmetrical examples and, depending on the precise meteorological conditions (the air temperature and humidity), snow can also fall as simpler hexagonal plates or prisms. All the same, the variety and complexity of snowfl akes can be stunning, and it is a mystery even now why so often each arm mirrors the others down to the finest detail.
A typical snowfl ake arm is a needlelike ice crystal decorated by smaller needles that branch off at the “hexagonal angle” of 60˚. Why this branching? And why this hexagonality?
冰之花
雪崩显示出晶体形成潜力最大的模式。虽然开普勒猜测晶体的几何规律性的根本原因，但在雪崩中，这种有序性被视为万花筒极端，创造了六边形对称性几乎被装饰到荒谬程度的形状。如果原子和分子结合在一起会产生块状的小平面，那么为什么这些冰晶呈现出如此精致而华丽的形状呢？
有些雪花比其他的更好看。在雪佛兰AKE图片中通常显示出的壮观的正面FL通常是从不太完美的对称例子中挑选出来的，并且，根据精确的气象条件（空气温度和湿度），雪也可以像简单的六边形板或棱镜一样下降。尽管如此，雪花的多样性和复杂性也令人叹为观止，这是一个谜，即使是现在，为什么每一只手臂都会把其他人反射到最好的细节上。
一个典型的雪花臂是一种针状冰晶，由较小的针头装饰，以60度的“六边形角”分支。为什么分支？为什么这个六边形呢？

Although no other kind of crystal comes close to snowflakes for elaborate beauty, their pattern is not totally unique. When some molten metals solidify quickly, they too can sprout Christmastreelike arms. This phenomenon is called dendritic growth, after the Greek word for branch.
Dendritic growth is an example of a growth instability, which basically means that something gets blown up out of control as a shape or pattern grows. We saw in Chapter 2 how aggregation due to the sticking of randomly drifting particles produces the tenuous forms of fractals. Any bump that appears by chance on the surface of the cluster grows faster than the rest simply because it is more exposed. So randomness at the surface quickly gets amplified and the cluster sprawls into its monstrous, tendriled form.
虽然没有其他种类的水晶接近雪花，但它们的图案并不完全是独一无二的。当一些熔融金属快速凝固时，它们也能萌芽出类似于圣诞节的手臂。这种现象被称为树突生长，之后是希腊语分支。
枝晶生长是生长不稳定性的一个例子，这基本上意味着当形状或图案生长时，某些东西会失控。我们在第2章中看到了由于随机漂流颗粒的粘附而产生的聚集如何产生分形的脆弱形式。任何偶然出现在集群表面上的凸点都比其他区域增长得快，因为它暴露得更多。因此，表面上的随机性很快被放大，簇扩展成其庞大的、卷曲的形式。

Something similar happens in dendritic growth during freezing of a liquid: a random bump grows faster than the surface around it,this time because the bump is better at radiating away heat so that more crystal can grow there.
But this alone would make snowflakes ragged fractals. What about the hexagonal regularity?
This comes from the crystal structure of the ice itself, which contains water molecules linked into hexagonal rings. This structure means that the branching instability happens on a kind of microscopic hexagonal grid that sets up a bias for the directions in which the branches grow: they surge ahead faster at the hexagonal angles than at others. The combination of random branching and orderly underlying lattice creates the exquisite complexity of the snowflake, poised on the brink of chaos and minutely sensitive to tiny variations in the temperature and humidity of the air. This acute sensitivity ensures that no two snowflakes seem to be exactly alike: they are endless variations on a theme, as if trying to convince us of nature’s intrinsic creativity.
在液体冻结过程中树突的生长也会发生类似的变化：一个随机的凸起比它周围的表面生长得更快，这一次是因为凸起在散热方面更好，所以更多的晶体可以在那里生长。
但这只会让雪花碎裂。六边形规则是什么？
这来自于冰本身的晶体结构，它包含与六方环相连的水分子。这种结构意味着分支不稳定性发生在一种微观的六边形网格上，它为分支生长的方向设置偏置：它们在六边形角度比其他的更快地向前移动。随机分支和有序底层晶格的组合创造了雪花的精致复杂性，在混沌的边缘上，对空气温度和湿度的微小变化敏感。这种敏锐的敏感性确保了两个雪花看起来完全一样：它们是一个主题的无休止的变化，好像试图说服我们大自然的内在创造力。


Chemical gardens
Isaac Newton was convinced that metals and minerals possess what he called a “vegetative soul,” because of the way they could grow into structures that looked more like plants than crystals. Newton experimented with what are now often called chemical gardens—metal salts precipitated in a solution of what in Newton’s day was known as oil of sand,which is sodium or potassium silicate (water glass). The salts grow into weird tentacles and branching fronds, because the silicate forms a tough but flexible and water-permeable skin, through which the salt repeatedly bursts out upward.
化学花园
艾萨克·牛顿确信金属和矿物拥有他所谓的“营养灵魂”，因为它们可以生长成看起来更像植物而不是晶体的结构。牛顿实验了现在被称为“化学花园”的金属盐，在牛顿的日子里被称为“沙子油”，即钠或硅酸钾（水玻璃）。盐变成怪异的触须和分支的叶，因为硅酸盐形成坚硬但柔韧和透水的皮肤，盐通过它反复向上迸发。

The structures that result are peculiarly lifelike: they could be bizarre, bulbous root vegetables from an alien world. Some scientists speculate that complex mineral structures like this, wrapped in membranes, might have played a part in the origin of primitive life on Earth at deep-sea hydrothermal vents where warm mineralrich fluids spew out from the Earth’s crust.
A team of researchers at Harvard University has devised a particularly floral variant of the chemical garden process. They adjusted the acidity and concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in the solution as crystals precipitated in water glass. This caused the tips of growing tendrils to blossom into curved and ruffled conelike shapes that, when examined under the microscope, look like flowers or corals—a chemical garden truly worthy of the name, and an indication that even crystals can escape from the chains of geometry to offer patterns of vivid,uninhibited artistry.
其结果是非常逼真的结构：它们可能是奇异的，来自异国世界的球根蔬菜。一些科学家推测，像这样包裹在膜中的复杂矿物结构，可能在深海热液喷口地球原始生命的起源中起了一定的作用，其中富含热的富含矿物质的流体从地球地壳喷出。
哈佛大学的一组研究人员设计出了一种特别的花卉化学变体。它们调节溶液中溶解的二氧化碳的酸度和浓度，作为沉淀在水玻璃中的结晶。这使得卷须的花瓣绽放成弯曲和皱褶的锥形形状，当在显微镜下观察时，它看起来像花朵或科拉尔——一个真正名副其实的化学园地，甚至表明晶体可以从几何链中逃逸出来。NS的生动，无拘束的艺术。

and, depending on the precise meteorological conditions (the air temperature and humidity), snow can also fall as simpler hexagonal plates or prisms. All the same, the variety and complexity of snowfl akes can be stunning, and it is a mystery even now why so often each arm mirrors the others down to the finest detail.

A typical snowfl ake arm is a needlelike ice crystal decorated by smaller needles that branch off at the “hexagonal angle” of 60˚. Why this branching? And why this hexagonality?
而且，根据精确的气象条件（空气温度和湿度），雪也可以像简单的六边形板或棱镜一样下降。尽管如此，雪花的多样性和复杂性也令人叹为观止，这是一个谜，即使是现在，为什么每一只手臂都会把其他人反射到最好的细节上。
一个典型的雪花臂是一种针状冰晶，由较小的针头装饰，以60度的“六边形角”分支。为什么分支？为什么这个六边形呢？

Although no other kind of crystal comes close to snowflakes for elaborate beauty, their pattern is not totally unique. When some molten metals solidify quickly, they too can sprout Christmastreelike arms. This phenomenon is called dendritic growth, after the Greek word for branch.
Dendritic growth is an example of a growth instability, which basically means that something gets blown up out of control as a shape or pattern grows. We saw in Chapter 2 how aggregation due to the sticking of randomly drifting particles produces the tenuous forms of fractals. Any bump that appears by chance on the surface of the cluster grows faster than the rest simply because it is more exposed. So randomness at the surface quickly gets amplified and the cluster sprawls into its monstrous, tendriled form.
虽然没有其他种类的水晶接近雪花，但它们的图案并不完全是独一无二的。当一些熔融金属快速凝固时，它们也能萌芽出类似于圣诞节的手臂。这种现象被称为树突生长，之后是希腊语分支。
枝晶生长是生长不稳定性的一个例子，这基本上意味着当形状或图案生长时，某些东西会失控。我们在第2章中看到了由于随机漂流颗粒的粘附而产生的聚集如何产生分形的脆弱形式。任何偶然出现在集群表面上的凸点都比其他区域增长得快，因为它暴露得更多。因此，表面上的随机性很快被放大，簇扩展成其庞大的、卷曲的形式。

Something similar happens in dendritic growth during freezing of a liquid: a random bump grows faster than the surface around it,this time because the bump is better at radiating away heat so that more crystal can grow there.
But this alone would make snowflakes ragged fractals. What about the hexagonal regularity?
This comes from the crystal structure of the ice itself, which contains water molecules linked into hexagonal rings. This structure means that the branching instability happens on a kind of microscopic hexagonal grid that sets up a bias for the directions in which the branches grow:
They surge ahead faster at the hexagonal angles than at others. The combination of random branching and orderly underlying lattice creates the exquisite complexity of the snowflake, poised on the brink of chaos and minutely sensitive to tiny variations in the temperature and humidity of the air. This acute sensitivity ensures that no two snowflakes seem to be exactly alike: they are endless variations on a theme, as if trying to convince us of nature’s intrinsic creativity.
在液体冻结过程中树突的生长也会发生类似的变化：一个随机的凸起比它周围的表面生长得更快，这一次是因为凸起在散热方面更好，所以更多的晶体可以在那里生长。
但这只会让雪花碎裂。六边形规则是什么？
这来自于冰本身的晶体结构，它包含与六方环相连的水分子。这种结构意味着分支不稳定性发生在一种微观的六边形网格上，它为分支生长的方向设置偏置。
它们在六角上比其他人更快地向前移动。随机分支和有序底层晶格的组合创造了雪花的精致复杂性，在混沌的边缘上，对空气温度和湿度的微小变化敏感。这种敏锐的敏感性确保了两个雪花看起来完全一样：它们是一个主题的无休止的变化，好像试图说服我们大自然的内在创造力。



CRYSTAL FLOWERS
Careful control of the growth conditions—temperature, acidity, and concentration of dissolved gas—gives rise to these ornate and diverse crystal shapes of barium carbonate and silica precipitated in a solution of metal salts. The basic forms are shaped like stems, vases, and corals; by switching the conditions during growth, the crystals can be guided into these and other flowerlike structures. The colors have been added to the image artificially to enhance the “botanical” appearance.
水晶花
仔细控制生长条件温度、酸度和溶解气体的浓度，会产生这些在金属盐溶液中沉淀的碳酸钡和二氧化硅的华丽和多样的晶体形状。基本形态如茎、花瓶和珊瑚；通过在生长过程中切换条件，晶体可以被引导进入这些和其他花状结构。颜色被人工添加到图像中以增强“植物学”的外观。


INTERFERENCE
The colors of this complex layered crystal in the shell of the New Zealand paua mollusk (1) and in the texture of this liquid crystal (2) are produced by interference effects in light. These may pick out the microscopic structures of the material. In the shell, we can see the terracelike layering of the hard mineral, organized by soft organic tissues during shell growth, while in the liquid crystal the microscopic structure comes from the shared orientation of rod-shaped molecules packed together.
干扰
在新西兰PaaA软体动物（1）的壳中和在该液晶（2）的织构中，这种复杂层状晶体的颜色是由光的干涉效应产生的。这些可以挑出材料的微观结构。在壳中，我们可以看到硬壳矿物的梯形层，在壳生长期间由软的有机组织组织，而在液晶中，微观结构来自棒状分子聚集在一起的共同取向。





CRYSTAL TREES
In the process known as dendritic growth, seen here in magnesium citrate (1) and ice (2), a growing crystal acquires a needlelike shape that is then decorated with side branches at successively finer scales. This process happens when tiny random bumps at the surface of the solidifying crystal get amplified and sharpened, because they are better at radiating the heat that needs to be shed for crystallization to occur. This, then, is another feedback process that generates pattern from randomness—in this case, given a degree of regularity by the order in the underlying atomic structure of the crystal.
水晶树
在被称为树枝状生长的过程中，如在柠檬酸镁（1）和冰（2）中看到的，生长的晶体获得针状形状，然后在连续精细的尺度上用侧枝装饰。这一过程发生在凝固晶体表面的微小随机凸点被放大和锐化时，因为它们更好地辐射了需要为结晶产生的热辐射。然后，这是另一个反馈过程，在这种情况下由随机性产生模式，根据晶体底层原子结构的顺序给出一定的规律性。



FORMING ICE PATTERNS
The precise patterns formed by dendritic growth of ice on surfaces are a combination of chance and determinism. In general, the crystals branch repeatedly, but each individual crystal is often seeded by an impurity or defect on the solid surface—so that, for example, they might follow the tracks of almost invisible scratches on glass.
冰型形成
表面上冰的树枝状生长形成的精确图案是机会和决定论的结合。一般来说，晶体反复分支，但每个单独的晶体常常被固体表面上的杂质或缺陷所播种，例如，它们可能跟随玻璃上几乎看不见的划痕。




CRYSTAL RAINBOWS
Some crystals, particularly those of organic compounds such as vitamins and amino acids, have a property called birefringence, which means that light rays passing through them can be split into two. These two beams can then interfere with each other, picking out particular colors from the visible spectrum when the crystals are viewed with polarized light. The spectacular color displays accentuate the shapes and textures of the crystals, which are formed as they grow. The examples shown here are magnesium citrate (1), vitamin C (2), and cholesterol (3).
水晶彩虹
一些晶体，特别是有机化合物，如维生素和氨基酸，有一种称为双折射的性质，这意味着穿过它们的光线可以分裂成两个。然后，这两个光束可以相互干涉，当用偏振光观察晶体时，从可见光谱中挑选出特定的颜色。壮观的彩色显示突出了晶体的形状和纹理，这些晶体是随着它们生长而形成的。这里所示的例子是柠檬酸镁（1）、维生素C（2）和胆固醇（3）。





MOLECULAR MEETINGS
The textures of liquid crystals, revealed by interference of polarized light, are wonderfully varied. Some of the structures in these patterns comes from socalled “defects” where the stacking arrangement of the molecules contains an irregularity—for example, boundaries where sideby-side molecules slant in different directions (like partings in hair) or singularities where molecules radiating in different directions converge at a point (like the crown in hair, or the poles of the Earth’s magnetic field).
分子会议
由偏振光的干涉所揭示的液晶的纹理是非常不同的。这些模式中的一些结构来自所谓的“缺陷”，其中分子的堆叠排列包含不规则性，例如，侧边分子在不同方向上倾斜的边界（如头发中的部分）或分子辐射的奇点。在不同的方向上汇聚在一点（如头发中的冠，或地球磁场的两极）。





1 and 2 THE MANY FACETS OF CRYSTALS
The shapes of crystals often reflect the symmetries of the stacking arrangements for their constituent atoms and molecules. Thus the square shapes of crystals of common salt (1) stem from the cubic arrays of the sodium and chloride ions from which they are made.
Likewise for the rhombusshaped cross-section of magnesium sulfate crystals (2).
1和2晶体的许多方面
晶体的形状通常反映其组成原子和分子的堆叠排列的对称性。因此，普通盐晶体（1）的正方形形状来源于它们所制备的钠和氯离子的立方阵列。
同样地，对于菱形截面的硫酸镁晶体（2）。


3 CHANGE OF STRUCTURE
Here crystals of copper sulfate—the light blue blobs—are embellished with white needlelike crystals, which are also copper sulfate but lack the water molecules that are incorporated into the blue material. This white form grows more quickly and in a different shape.
3结构变化
在这里，硫酸铜晶体的浅蓝色斑点被白色针状晶体点缀，这些晶体也是硫酸铜，但缺少结合在蓝色材料中的水分子。这种白色的形态生长得更快，形状也不同。




HEXAGONAL BRANCHING
Snowflakes seem to provide inexhaustible invention on the hexagonal theme. The branching of arms and hexagonality of the pattern are now well understood, but mysteries remain. It’s not fully obvious why the ice crystals grow as flat plates (other shapes are also possible under different conditions of air temperature and humidity), nor why all the branches are nearly identical. Not all snowflakes are this perfectly symmetrical, however.
六边形分支
雪花似乎为六边形主题提供了无穷的发明。武器的分支和模式的六方性现在已经很好地理解了，但是奥秘仍然存在。冰晶为什么会像平板一样生长（在不同的空气温度和湿度条件下，其他形状也是可能的），也不清楚为什么所有的树枝几乎是相同的。然而，并非所有雪花都是完全对称的。




1 and 2 VIRAL SYMMETRY
Even some biological objects have a crystallike regularity at the molecular scale. Viruses, such as the West Nile virus (1) and simian virus 40 (2), are particularly good examples: they are made of protein molecules packed together in a shell called a capsid, with the genetic material packaged inside. The capsids commonly show fivefold symmetries.
1和2病毒对称性
甚至一些生物对象在分子尺度上也有类似晶体的规律性。病毒，如西尼罗河病毒（1）和猿猴病毒40（2），都是很好的例子：它们是由蛋白质分子包在一起的壳壳中，遗传物质被包装在壳体内。衣壳通常显示五倍对称性。

3 and 4 DISCOVERING ORDER
The atomic-scale order of crystals was first seen directly using techniques called field emission microscopy and field ion microscopy, in which each bright dot (seen here for the metals iridium [3] and platinum [4]) corresponds to a single atom at the surface of a fine tip.
3和4发现顺序
首先使用场发射显微镜和场离子显微镜技术直接看到晶体的原子级顺序，其中每个亮点（在这里看到的金属铱（3）和铂（4））对应于在精细尖端表面的单个原子。

5 X-RAY REVELATION
The most common way to figure out the atomic-scale structure of a crystal is called X-ray diffraction. The interference of X-rays bouncing off different layers of atoms in the crystal creates a series of bright X-ray spots, which can be recorded (originally on photographic film) and decoded mathematically to  deduce where the atoms are. The technique was invented over a hundred years ago, and can now be used to reveal the structures even of complicated biological molecules, such as the enzyme that produced this diffraction pattern. This is how the doublehelix structure of DNA was deduced in 1953.
5 X线透视
确定晶体的原子尺度结构最常用的方法叫做X射线衍射。X射线在晶体中不同层原子的干涉产生了一系列明亮的X射线斑点，它们可以被记录下来（最初在照相胶片上），并在数学上进行解码，从而推断出原子的位置。这项技术是在一百多年前发明的，现在可以用来揭示复杂生物分子的结构，例如产生这种衍射图案的酶。这就是DNA的双螺旋结构是如何在1953推导出来的。




CHEMICAL GARDENS
When crystalline solids are precipitated from dissolved salts in a solution of water glass (sodium silicate), the silicate can form a soft membrane around the growing crystal that dictates its shape, producing bulbous, “organic” structures. Every so often, pressure differences on each side of the membrane may cause it to rupture, releasing jets of solution that crystallize into “branches.” In this way, the crystalline material comes to look more  like a plant form. These structures are commonly called chemical gardens. When this same process is carried out in the narrow space between two flat plates, the crystal structures are more or less two-dimensional, and can take on ornate, curved forms like those shown here, made from a cobalt salt.
化学花园
当结晶固体从溶解的盐沉淀在水玻璃（硅酸钠）溶液中时，硅酸盐可以在生长的晶体周围形成柔软的膜，它决定其形状，产生球状的“有机”结构。每隔一段时间，膜两侧的压力差会使其破裂，释放出溶液结晶，形成“分支”。这样，晶体材料看起来更像植物形态。这些结构通常被称为化学花园。当在相同的两个平板之间的狭窄空间中进行同样的过程时，晶体结构或多或少是二维的，并且可以采用类似于这里所示的由钴盐制成的华丽、弯曲的形式。



MINERAL FILAMENTS
These are some of the delicate crystal structures produced in the chemical gardens described on page 196. Several different types of crystalline salt are growing in these gardens (not all of which are visible). Each has a characteristic color: copper nitrate (light blue), cobalt chloride (dark blue),ammonium iron sulfate (brown), magnesium nitrate (white), and iron sulfate (green).
矿物长丝
这些是在第196页中描述的化学花园中产生的一些微妙的晶体结构。在这些花园中生长着几种不同类型的结晶盐（并非所有的都是可见的）。每一种都有一种特有的颜色：硝酸铜（淡蓝色）、氯化钴（深蓝）、硫酸铁铵（棕色）、硝酸镁（白色）和硫酸铁（绿）。






1–3 CRYSTAL CAVES
When minerals grow slowly underground from the cooling of warm fluids rich in dissolved salts, the crystals can grow to immense sizes, such as these pillars of selenite (a kind of gypsum) in the Naica mines of Mexico.
1至3水晶洞穴
当矿物从富含溶解盐的温热流体中缓慢地下生长时，晶体可以生长成巨大的尺寸，例如墨西哥奈卡矿中的这些亚硒酸钠柱（一种石膏）。

4 NEEDLE WORK
Crystals of aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate, grown slowly in a French cave.
The shapes of crystals like this depend on the precise arrangements of the constituent atoms and ions—but the growth must be very slow to allow such large, perfect crystals to develop.
4针工作
文石的晶体，一种碳酸钙的形式，在法国洞穴中缓慢生长。
像这样的晶体的形状取决于组成原子和离子的精确排列，但是生长必须非常缓慢，以允许这样大的、完美的晶体发展。








8 CRACKS
How things fall apart and how a giant made his staircase
裂缝
事情是如何瓦解的，巨人是如何建造楼梯的


Breakage and decay seem like the very antithesis of order and organization, but surprisingly they too can produce varieties of pattern and structure. In some cases it might not look that way; cracks have a jagged chaos that speaks of wild disarray. But even this form recurs in so many different situations that we have to suspect it is the signature of a deeper design, a universal outcome of natural laws. And other crack patterns, like the trellis of fissures in pottery glaze or old paint, have a pleasing geometry of the same stamp which captivates us in foams, spiders’ webs, and wrinkle textures. We might even seek them out for their aesthetic appeal; cracking, far from being a nuisance, becomes a source of creative opportunity.
断裂和腐烂似乎是秩序和组织的对立物，但令人惊讶的是它们也能产生各种各样的图案和结构。在某些情况下，它可能不是那样的；裂缝有一个锯齿状的混乱，说明了混乱的混乱。但是，即使这种形式出现在许多不同的情况下，我们不得不怀疑它是一个更深层次的设计的标志，是自然法则的普遍结果。而其他裂缝图案，如陶器釉裂缝或旧漆的格子，有一个令人愉快的几何形状相同的邮票，它吸引我们在泡沫，蜘蛛网，和皱纹纹理。我们甚至可以寻找他们的审美吸引力；破裂，远离讨厌，成为一个创造性的机会来源。

Crash! Lightning forks down from the sky. Crack! The ground splits apart in an earthquake. Smash! A pottery jug falls to the floor. All of these events produce similar shapes: branching, jagged, forked, fragmented.
Coincidence? Of course not! The archetypal “geometry of failure”—the shapes that come from things breaking, splitting, cracking—is a fissure that branches, the branch tips splitting into ever more junctions and thereby generating another of nature’s fractal forms. We see these patterns not only in the cracks of a pavement slab, but also in the pattern of river networks—a kind of “slow crack” made as a river’s headwaters erode the landscape in which they form.
These majestic watercourses split apart the earth, carve out mountain ranges, nurture civilizations, and astonish us with their complexity.
The similarity between their shapes and those of the veins that carry blood around the human body was noticed many centuries ago, and stimulated the idea voiced both in ancient China and in Renaissance Europe that rivers are the “blood of the earth.” That’s not just a superficial and misguided pre-scientific analogy: modern science shows that these correspondences in appearance are indeed more than coincidental.
撞车！闪电从天上飞下来。裂开！地震中地面裂开了。粉碎！陶壶掉在地上。所有这些事件产生相似的形状：分支，锯齿状，分叉，碎片化。
巧合？当然不是！原型“失败的几何学”——来自断裂、分裂、开裂的形状是分支的裂缝，分支尖端分裂成越来越多的结，从而产生自然界的另一种分形形式。我们看到这些图案不仅在铺路板的裂缝中，而且在河网的模式中看到，一种“慢裂缝”，就像河流源头侵蚀了它们形成的景观。
这些宏伟的水道分开地球，开拓出山脉，培育文明，震惊了我们与他们的复杂性。
它们的形状和那些带血的人体周围静脉是注意到许多世纪以前之间的相似性，和刺激的思想在古代中国，表示在欧洲文艺复兴时期，河流是地球的“血液”，这不只是一个肤浅和误导D前科学的比喻：现代科学研究表明，这些对应的外观的确比偶然。

Out of action
The explanation for the patterns in both cases may not be so different from that for the simple parabolic path of a golf ball soaring into the air and falling back to the green. But what, you might ask, can the jagged trajectory of water plunging down mountain slopes have in common with the smooth, graceful arc of a ball moving through empty space?
Both are bodies in motion, moving under the force of gravity. For the golf ball, that movement is described by Isaac Newton’s laws of mechanics,which relate the velocity and acceleration of the ball to the forces acting on it. Solve Newton’s equations and you predict the parabola.
But there’s another way to do that reckoning. You can write down a quantity called the action, which depends on the energies of the ball’s motion—its gravitational energy, due to being high in the sky, and its kinetic energy due to its movement. Then, to deduce the ball’s trajectory, you have to figure out which path produces the smallest amount of this quantity called action.
失去作用
对这两种情况的解释可能与高尔夫球的简单抛物线路径不一样，它们是向空中飘落并退回绿色的。但是，你可能会问，山坡上水流颠簸的轨迹会不会像一个球在空旷的空间中流畅、优美的弧线一样？
两个物体都在运动，在重力的作用下移动。对于高尔夫球来说，这种运动是由艾萨克·牛顿的力学定律描述的，它把球的速度和加速度和作用在球上的力联系起来。求解牛顿方程并预测抛物线。
但是还有另一种方法来解决这个问题。你可以写下一个叫做动作的量，它取决于球的运动能量，重力能量，由于天空中的高，以及它的运动所产生的动能。然后，推导出球的轨迹，你必须找出这路径产生最小的数量称为行动。

Think of this as something loosely like “effort.” Which path do you take to go to the store? The one (probably) that requires the least effort.
Which path does the ball take? The one that requires the least action. Just as the “law of least action” defines the parabola of a falling ball, so is there a law of “least something” that defines the path of water flowing down a hill. That “something” is the rate at which the water’s gravitational energy, due to its initial position high up on the slope, is expended and dissipated. This prescription produces a trajectory of water flow that looks just like the fractal network of a river basin. But how does all the water “know” which network dissipation? It doesn’t, of course. If we assume only that the water falls on a randomly bumpy surface and flows down the steepest gradient, and that this flow will, if fast enough, erode and carry away some of the ground, then we find that the pattern of flow spontaneously evolves into a “minimal network.” From simple “local” rules that describe how each little part of the flow behaves, a grand design emerges: the design we see for the Yangtze, the Amazon, the Rhine. Not only does it produce the characteristically branched aerial view of a river basin, but at the same time it wears away a bland, randomly rough landscape into one graced with soaring peaks, plunging precipices, and sharply incized valleys—all from a single generative principle.
把它想象成一个松散的“努力”，你会去哪条路去商店？一个（可能）需要最少的努力。
球走哪条路？需要最少行动的人。正如“最小作用定律”定义了落球的抛物线，所以有一个“最小的东西”定律定义了水下山的路径。“某物”是水的重力能量，由于其初始位置在斜坡上的高度，被消耗和消散。这个处方产生了一个水流的轨迹，看起来就像一个流域的分形网络。但所有的水如何“知道”哪个网络消散？当然不是这样。如果我们假设水落在一个随机的凹凸不平的表面上，并沿着最陡峭的坡度流，并且这个流将足够快地侵蚀和带走一些地面，那么我们发现流动模式自发地从简单的“局部”演变为“最小的网络”。“规则描述了流动的每一个小部分，一个宏伟的设计出现了：我们为Yangtze、亚马逊河、莱茵河所看到的设计。它不仅产生典型的分枝鸟瞰河流流域，但同时穿平淡无奇，随机粗糙景观成一个高耸的山峰，登上悬崖暴跌，大幅incized山谷所有从一个单一的生成原理。



THE EARTH MOVES
Cracks are typically ragged-edged; some have a fractal profile.
But there’s a particular direction to them, too; here again is the familiar balance of chance and determinism.

裂缝通常是粗糙的边缘；有一个分形轮廓。
但有一个特定的方向，这里太；又是机会和决定熟悉的平衡。




CRYSTAL CLEAR

COASTAL EROSION
Erosion by water (sea and surf) sculpts many coastlines into complex, irregular shapes with a fractal structure.
海岸侵蚀
被水侵蚀（海上冲浪）造型很多海岸线到复杂的、有不规则形状的分形结构。


On the edge
There’s not so much difference between a river eroding a mountain and a sea eroding a coastline: in both cases, the energy of the water’s movement batters and abrades the rock, breaking off little particles and carrying them away to carve out a particular shape. And in both cases, a combination of randomness and feedback turns what was once uniform into something pitted, uneven, and fractal.
Coastlines have a special place in the story of fractal patterns, for they were one of the natural forms that prompted Benoit Mandelbrot to come up with the concept of self-similarity, this elaboration on ever smaller scales. And yet it wasn’t until rather recently that a good theory of how coasts get their shape was cooked up. Imagine a coastline that is randomly shaped (remember, that’s not the same as fractal) and where the rock type—and therefore resistance to erosion—varies randomly from place to place.
There’s some gradual and constant erosion as the rocks slowly dissolve in water, and also some fast, sporadic erosion caused by storms.
在边缘
没有河流侵蚀一山一海侵蚀海岸线之间的差异很大：在这两种情况下，水的运动能量和打磨的击球手的岩石，折断的小颗粒和载着他们去开拓出一个特定的形状。而在这两种情况下，组合的随机性和反馈变成曾经统一变成坑坑洼洼，凹凸不平，分形。
海岸线的分形图案的故事中有一个特殊的地方，因为他们是一个自然的形式，促使Benoit Mandelbrot想出了自相似性的概念，阐述在更小的尺度。然而，直到最近，一个好而如何得到其形状理论海岸被煮熟了。想象一个海岸线，是随机形成的（记住，这不是一样的，分形）的岩石类型，因此耐侵蚀性随机变化的地方。
有一些渐进的和持续的侵蚀的岩石慢慢溶解在水中，也有些快，零星的侵蚀引起的风暴。

How does the shape of the coast evolve under these conditions? What begins as random becomes ever more irregular and fractal, as little ever more irregular and fractal, as little dips are hollowed out into big bays while small protrusions are sculpted into jutting headlands. Whether a section of coast is removed depends partly on how strong the rock is, but also on how exposed it is. By the same token, the coastline’s shape feeds back on the ocean forces that generate it: the more convoluted it becomes, the more it disrupts and damps down the waves, slowing the erosion. Out of this complex interplay of effects come structures that resemble the true forms of the land’s end, with their islands, fjords, and peninsulas.
These geological processes of erosion happen over decades, centuries, millennia. Can they have much in common with the kind of breakdown that takes place in the blink of an eye, as a window shatters or a lightning bolt forks through the torpid summer sky? That’s not obvious, and yet the patterns seem to insist on the analogy—for doesn’t lightning take on the same branched, fractal form as a river network?
在这些条件下海岸的形状是如何演变的？从随机开始，变得越来越不规则和分形，几乎没有任何不规则和分形，因为小凹陷被掏空成大海湾，而小突起则被雕刻成凸起的岬角。一段海岸是否被移除，部分取决于岩石的强度，也取决于它是如何暴露的。同样的道理，海岸线的形状又反馈到产生海洋的力量：它变得越卷曲，它越扰乱和减弱波浪，减缓侵蚀。在这种复杂的相互作用中，产生了类似于陆地尽头的真实形态的结构，它们的岛屿、峡湾和半岛。
这些侵蚀的地质过程发生了几十年、几百年、几千年。它们能在眨眼间发生类似的破坏吗？就像一扇窗户碎了，或者闪电穿过夏日的微风？这不是显而易见的，然而，这些模式似乎坚持这样的类比：闪电不是同一条支流的分形形式，就像河网一样吗？

The splitting of a material as high-voltage electricity courses through it is called dielectric breakdown. The pattern of the crack is like a frozen replica of the spark that caused it, and is called a Lichtenberg figure, after the German scientist who first investigated this kind of breakdown. In a three-dimensional block of clear plastic it is like a barren tree or fantastic marine weed, extending its fingers throughout the material. Here is a real marriage of lightning and cracking, a substance split by electricity into a rich record of fractal failure. Can we account for it?
Imagine dumping a dollop of electrical charge into the center of a slab of material, so that it wants to flow out to the edges as the charged particles repel one another. Which path does the flow of electricity take?
Like water on a hillslope, it seeks out the steepest gradient; that’s to say, it will advance from wherever the electric field at the boundary of the discharge is strongest. And those places are where the boundary is the sharpest: at bulges and tips. That’s why lightning conductors on buildings are sharp spikes: they encourage the electrical discharge to happen there.
This forward surge of a tip is complicated by randomness—by little chance fluctuations in the electric field or in the material’s structure that can generate new bumps that themselves then rapidly sprout into a new tip. So the tips split as they advance, and the result is a treelike, branching form.
将材料劈开作为高压电的过程被称为电介质击穿。裂纹的模式就像是一个引起它的火花的冷冻复制品，被称为Ligtnigg图形，在德国科学家首次研究了这种击穿之后。在一个三维的透明塑料块中，它像一棵贫瘠的树或奇妙的海草，在整个材料中伸展手指。这是一个真正的闪电和破裂的婚姻，一个由电分裂成丰富的分形破坏记录的物质。我们能解释一下吗？
想象一下，把一大堆电荷扔进一块材料的中心，这样它就想在带电粒子互相排斥时向边缘流动。电力流走哪条路？
就像山坡上的水一样，它寻找最陡峭的坡度；也就是说，它会从放电边界处的电场最强的地方前进。这些地方是边界最锋利的地方：凸起和尖端。这就是为什么建筑物上的闪电导体是尖峰的原因：它们鼓励放电发生在那里。
尖端的正向浪涌是由随机性复杂的，因为电场或材料结构中的小的偶然波动会产生新的凸点，然后它们会迅速萌生成新的尖端。所以尖端随着它们的前进而分裂，结果是树状的、分支的形式。

Depending on the atmospheric conditions, this elaboration of a lightning bolt can create dramatic,spectacular, natural rivers of electricity.
This description of dielectric breakdown can be modified to account for cracking, too. Here, instead of thinking about the path of the electrical current, we think of the path opened up by breakage of the material. Again that breakage is most likely at the crack tips, because this time it is the stress that is greatest at the tip. And once more, randomness—variations in the strength of the material, say, or pre-existing little cracks and flaws—induces tip-splitting and branching.
根据大气条件，这种闪电的制作可以创造出引人注目、壮观、自然的电力河流。
这种介电击穿的描述也可以被修改以解释开裂。这里，我们不考虑电流的路径，而是考虑材料断裂所造成的路径。同样，断裂最有可能在裂纹尖端，因为这次是尖端处最大的应力。再一次，材料强度的随机性变化，例如，或预先存在的小裂纹和缺陷引起尖端分裂和分支。


DEATH VALLEY, USA
When mud lying on the bottom of a dried-up lake becomes dry and shrinks as water is removed from between the fine particles, stresses build up that lead eventually to cracking. The patterns are a fine balance of order and disorder. The cracks may be jagged, but they divide up the dry layer into islands that have roughly the same size and are often approximately polygonal in shape. This pattern is typically the one that is most efficient at relieving the stresses in the contracting material.
美国死亡谷
当干涸的湖泊底部的泥浆变得干燥和收缩时，细颗粒之间的水被去除，应力导致最终导致破裂。这些模式是秩序和混乱的完美平衡。裂纹可能是锯齿状的，但它们将干燥层分成大小大致相同且形状近似多边形的岛屿。这种模式通常是最有效地缓解收缩材料中的应力的模式。


Crazy paving
If a lake dries up, or if the moist soil of a pasture or garden becomes parched, the ground contracts as the water evaporates from between the soil particles. This means that the dry layer at the surface tries to shrink relative to the still-moist layer below, and the ground becomes laced with tension throughout. Then the surface breaks apart not with the appearance of a single, branching crack but by the formation of an interconnected network of fissures that split it into isolated islands.
These patterns, so familiar as a kind of pictorial shorthand for tales of drought, are rather beautiful.
They are also quite different from the fractal networks of dielectric breakdown and river erosion.
疯狂铺路
如果湖泊干涸，或者牧场或花园潮湿的土壤变得干涸，土壤就在土壤颗粒之间蒸发而收缩。这意味着表面上的干层相对于下面的潮湿层试图收缩，并且整个地面变得紧张。然后，表面破裂而不是单个分支裂缝的出现，而是形成裂缝的相互连接的网络，将裂缝分裂成孤立的岛屿。
这些图案，作为一种关于干旱故事的速记图案，非常熟悉。
它们与介电击穿和河流侵蚀的分形网络也有很大的不同。

The islands often have a polygonal shape defi ned by their fl at edges, although sometimes the edges are less smooth and more erratic. The crack lines intersect rather cleanly, usually at relatively large angles of around 60–90o. There is a universal character to these patterns, too: we recognize them not just in dried-up lake beds but in pottery glazes such as raku and in the fl aking of paint. The driving force is much the same in all cases: the glaze, say, bound to the ceramic surface, cracks as it cools and contracts. The result is so pleasing that in pottery it may be induced on purpose.
What dictates this artful geometry? It seems again to be governed by a minimization rule: the cracks take paths that release the stress in the shrinking layer as effectively as possible.
In glazes this happens when the cracks meet at right-angle junctions, and so the cracks are shaped and positioned to enable this, even if it means that one crack must bend as it approaches another.
岛上经常有一个多边形，定义由佛罗里达州的边缘，虽然有时边缘欠光滑和更不稳定。裂纹线相交而干净，通常在比较大的角度在60–90o。有一个普遍的特征：我们认识到这些模式，他们不只是在干涸的湖床在陶器釉如乐和油漆的佛罗里达州以。在所有的情况下，驱动力是一样的：釉，说，绑定到陶瓷表面，因为它冷却并收缩裂缝。结果是让人赏心悦目，陶可诱导的目的。
是什么决定了这种巧妙的几何学？似乎又是由一个最小化原则：裂缝采取的路径，释放压力在收缩层尽可能有效。
在釉料中这发生在当裂纹遇到直角连接，因此裂纹的形状和位置使这个，即使这意味着一个裂纹必须当它接近一个弯。

Stress-relieving crack networks carve out some of nature’s most spectacular fracture patterns: the hexagonal pillars of rock found at Fingal’s Cave off the coast of Scotland, the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, and the Devil’s Postpile in California. How nature can produce formations so seemingly ordered, geometrical, almost designed, has perplexed scientists and philosophers for centuries. It isn’t hard to understand how these patterns, just like the hexagonal perfection of the bee’s honeycomb, must have convinced scientists and naturalists of earlier ages that they were seeing the work of the divine—or the supernatural.
Fingal’s Cave was traditionally said to have been part of an immense paved causeway across the North Channel above the Irish Sea, stretching from Ireland to Scotland and built by the Irish giant Finn  MacCool (Fingal) so that he could stride across to fight a rival Scottish giant. This bridge, it was said, began in County Antrim, where today the Giant’s Causeway stands on the wild coast.
These geological formations were created as volcanic rock surged to the planet’s surface and hardened around 60 million years ago. Why the stresses induced by cooling and contraction of the molten rock should have generated so orderly a system of fissures puzzled scientists for a long time.
应力释放裂缝网络挖掘出一些自然界最壮观的裂缝模式：在苏格兰海岸的Fingal洞穴发现的岩石的六边形柱子，北爱尔兰的巨型堤道，以及加利福尼亚的魔鬼桩。大自然如何能产生看似有序、几何、几乎被设计的地层，使科学家和哲学家困惑了几个世纪。不难理解这些模式，就像蜜蜂蜂巢的六边形完美，必须让早期科学家和博物学家相信他们看到的是神圣或超自然的工作。
传统上说，Fingal的山洞是爱尔兰海北部通道上方的一条巨大铺设的堤道的一部分，从爱尔兰延伸到苏格兰，由爱尔兰巨人芬恩麦克库尔（Fingal）建造，这样他就可以跨过去与一个与之竞争的苏格兰巨人作战。这座桥，它是说，开始在安特里姆县，在今天的巨人站在狂野海岸。
这些地质层由火山岩上升到地球表面硬化，大约6000万年前。为什么应力引起的冷却的熔岩收缩应该产生如此整洁的裂隙系统困惑科学家很长时间。



A GIANT’S WORK
At Fingal’s Cave on the Isle of Staffa, Scotland,networks of cracks growing downward through a layer of cooling and solidifying basalt have become highly regular, almost geometric, so that they break up the rock into these prism-shaped columns, typically with six sides and a roughly hexagonal cross-section.
巨人的作品
在苏格兰斯塔法岛岛的芬加尔洞穴中，通过一层冷却和凝固玄武岩层向下生长的裂缝网络变得非常规则，几乎是几何的，因此它们将岩石分解成棱柱状的柱状物，通常有六个边和大致六角形的CRO。SS部分。


“Stress-relieving crack networks carve out some of nature’s most spectacular fracture patterns.”
“应力释放裂纹网络挖掘出自然界最壮观的断裂模式。”


The key issue is that here nature gets time to experiment and refine the arrangement of cracks so as to gradually find the “best” (and most orderly) answer. Cracking appears first at the surface of the cooling rock, since it is here that the heat escapes most quickly and the molten material begins to harden. At first, the stresses that build up in the solid layer are relieved by fractures appearing more or less at random points, and the network looks rather jumbled. But as the cracks descend through the solidifying mass, the network adjusts to release stress more effectively.
That happens when these cracks intersect in threes, with roughly equal angles between each of them—in other words, so that the junctions have the 120˚ angles characteristic of a honeycombshaped network of hexagons.
关键的问题是，这里的自然有时间来实验和完善裂缝的安排，以便逐步找到“最佳”（最有序的）答案。裂纹首先出现在冷却岩石的表面，因为在这里热量逸出最快，熔融材料开始硬化。起初，在固体层中建立的应力被随机点出现或多或少的裂缝减轻，并且网络看起来相当混乱。但是当裂纹通过凝固质量下降时，网络调节以更有效地释放应力。
发生这种情况时，这些裂缝相交三大致相等的角之间的每个人在其他的话，这样的路口有120˚角一honeycombshaped网络六边形特征。

That’s different from the case of a thin layer of glaze hardening on the surface of a pot, or of mud on a lake bed. For one thing, the cracks now are not just weaving horizontally across a flat layer, but are also descending through a thick slab of material as it cools or hardens. What’s more, the pattern isn’t constrained by the initial appearance of a few very long, smooth cracks, as it is in the glaze. For such reasons, hexagonal junctions are preferred over the right-angle junctions of raku. It’s the same basic idea—how best to release stress caused by shrinkage—but the solution is different.
这是不同的从一层薄釉硬化在锅表面的情况下，或在湖底泥。首先，裂缝现在不仅仅是编织横向平层，但也降下厚厚的一层物质遇冷或变硬。更重要的是，模式没有用一些很长的、平滑的初始裂纹出现的约束，因为它是在釉。因此，六路口优先在该直角接头。基本上是同样的想法如何最好的释放引起的收缩应力，但解决方案是不同的。
So as the crack network penetrates deeper down, it grows ever closer to an ideal honeycomb pattern. It never achieves that shape perfectly (many of the columns of the Giant’s Causeway are rather irregular hexagons, and some have five or seven sides), because there’s almost always a bit of disorder and randomness in the way nature makes its patterns. But the result is close enough to geometric perfection to astonish us.
The topmost layers of the rock formation are far less orderly—but these will have been removed long ago by erosion. What now remains is one of the most striking tributes to the self-organizing powers of the natural world.
因此，裂纹网络越深越深，越接近理想的蜂窝图案。它从来没有完美地达到这个形状（巨人的堤道的许多柱子都是不规则六边形，有些有五条或七条边），因为自然界的模式几乎总是有一点混乱和随机性。但是结果足够接近几何完美让我们吃惊。
岩层的最顶层远不那么有序，但这些将很早以前就被侵蚀掉了。现在剩下的是对自然世界自组织能力的最强烈的贡品之一。


1 CRACKS IN WOOD
In old, dead trees, cracks caused by stresses in the dry and contracting wood radiate from the center, but they are also deflected sideways at the boundaries between different seasonal growth la yers (the tree rings), where the wood fabric is relatively weaker.
木材1裂纹
在老、死树，裂缝应力引起的干燥收缩的木材从中心辐射，但他们也偏向一边，在不同的季节生长层之间的界限（年轮），其中木质纤维相对较弱。

2 GLAZED OVER
The network of cracks in pottery glaze is again caused by cooling and shrinkage of a thin layer, which sets up stresses. Here the process starts with some long, gently curving cracks, which are then interconnected by shorter cracks that generally join at right angles, producing polygonal islands.
2上釉
在陶瓷釉面裂纹网络再次被冷却，薄薄的一层收缩引起的应力，建立。在启动的过程有些长，轻轻弯曲裂缝，然后通过短裂纹，一般加入直角连接，生产多边形的岛屿。




1 and 2 FAMILIAR FORKING
The idea that river and stream networks are a kind of “breakdown” or cracking pattern becomes clear once we compare an example like this one, a stream from an Icelandic spring (1), with the forked network of a lightning strike (2). Lightning is an instance of so-called “dielectric breakdown,” when an electrical discharge passes through a normally insulating substance, in this case air.
1和2熟悉分叉
一旦我们比较一个例子，如冰岛泉（1）的水流，和闪电的分叉网络（2），河流和溪流网络是一种“崩溃”或破裂模式的想法就变得清晰了。闪电是所谓的“电介质击穿”的例子，当放电通过正常绝缘物质，在这种情况下，空气。

1 LAVA CRACKS
The initial stages in the formation of the Giant’s Causeway probably looked a bit like this—a crack network forming in the crust of molten lava. The islands here are rather more diverse in size and shape than the polygons of the Giant’s Causeway, but it’s thought that the crack network gradually reorganized itself as it penetrated deeper to become more regular. The irregular top layers were then removed by millions of years of erosion.
1熔岩裂缝
巨石堤形成的初始阶段可能看起来有点像一个在熔融熔岩壳中形成的裂隙网络。这里的岛屿在大小和形状上比巨型堤道的多边形要多样化得多，但是人们认为裂缝网络随着深度的加深而逐渐重组，从而变得更加规则。不规则的顶层随后被岁月的侵蚀数百万删除。

2 and 3 FLAKING PAINT
As paint dries, the pigment particles are pulled closer together and the film cracks. The process is very similar to the cooling of a glaze film in pottery, and the pattern looks much the same, too.
2和3剥落漆
油漆干燥，色素颗粒被紧密地联系在一起，这部电影的裂缝。这个过程是在陶瓷釉膜冷却非常相似，和图案看起来是一样的，太。




BRANCHING LIGHTNING
The forked branches of lightning are the result of another growth instability. As the electrical discharge passes through the air between the thundercloud and the ground, any small and random bumps at the tip become quickly amplified into a new branch, because the gradient of the electric field (how steeply the field changes over a given distance) is larger there and so the current is more likely to flow that way.
As is the case for many patterns that experience these branching instabilities, the structure that results is a fractal.
分支闪电
分叉的闪电分支是另一个生长不稳定的结果。当放电穿过雷云和地面之间的空气时，尖端上的任何小的和随机的凸起都会迅速被放大成新的分支，因为电场的梯度（电场在给定距离上的急剧变化）在那里更大，因此C。水流更可能这样流动。
对于经历这些分支不稳定性的许多模式来说，结果是一个分形结构。

CRACKED CRUST
Cracks may occur at geological scales, spreading over many miles through the Earth’s crust in earthquake zones where the movements of tectonic plates create stresses in the hard rock. Such faults, like the San Andreas Fault in California shown here, are often relatively straight and unbranched. They are cracks that extend deep into the crust.
裂隙地壳
裂缝可能发生在地质尺度上，在地球地壳中延伸很多英里，在地震带中，构造板块的运动在坚硬岩石中产生应力。像加利福尼亚的圣安德烈亚斯断层这样的断层通常是相对直的和不分枝的。它们是延伸到地壳深处的裂缝。




RIVER NETWORKS
These highly branched systems have more diverse and often more sinuous shapes than cracks in brittle material. That’s because the pattern is produced from several processes operating at the same time, such as erosion and deposition of sediment (which combine to create river meanders). The shape might also depend on local differences in the strength and chemical nature of the underlying rock.
河网
这些高度支化的系统比脆性材料裂纹更多样和更复杂的形状。这是因为模式是从几个进程同时运行产生，如侵蚀和沉积泥沙（这些创造河蜿蜒）。形状也可能取决于当地的差异在强度和化学的基础岩石性质。




DEVIL’S POSTPILE, USA
Polygonal columnar cracks like those that produced the Giant’s Causeway are rather rare in geology, but they do occur in a few other places—such as here, at the Devil’s Postpile in California.
魔鬼后桩，美国
多角形柱状裂缝，如产生巨型堤道的裂缝在地质上相当罕见，但它们确实发生在其他一些地方，如在这里，在加利福尼亚的魔鬼桩。


1 and 2 VISCOUS FINGERING
In this phenomenon, a less viscous fluid (such as air) is pushed or pulled under pressure into a more viscous one. When this happens, the boundary between the two fluids is subject to another branching growth instability: at any protrusion, the pressure in the invading fluid is greater, so it surges forward in a narrowing finger. Patterns like this are formed when a film of sticky fluid, like an adhesive or paint, between two flat plates is disrupted by pulling the plates apart, sucking air into the gap. The result is a tracery of fine channels, looking a bit like river networks (1). In some cases the fingering instabilty can be tempered by the force of surface tension, which acts to smooth a branch tip and make it less sharp.
Then the pattern can become a series of thicker branches (2).
1和2粘性指进
这一现象，少粘性流体（如空气）推或拉的压力下变成更多的粘性。当这种情况发生时，两流体之间的边界是受另一个分枝生长不稳定：在任何突起，在入侵的流体的压力更大，所以它奔腾在小指。这样的样式时形成的膜粘性流体，如粘合剂或涂料的两平板之间是通过拉板分开打乱，吸入空气间隙。其结果是一个花纹精细的渠道，看起来有点像河流网络（1）。在某些情况下，指法instabilty可以通过表面张力的力量锻炼，可以顺利的一个分支，并使它不锋利的尖。
然后模式可以成为一个系列的较粗的枝条（2）。



3 SINKING PLUMES
As a more dense fluid sinks through a less dense one, the blobs of the denser liquid split into fingers, which then split again and again, creating an inverted branching tree shape.
This, too, is a process of viscous fingering,and can occur in the oceans when colder or saltier water sinks through warmer or fresher water below.
3沉羽
当一个更稠密的流体通过一个不那么致密的流体下沉时，稠密液体的斑点分裂成手指，然后再次分裂，产生倒置的分支树形状。
这也是粘性指进的过程，当较冷或咸水通过较温暖或较新鲜的水下沉时，会发生在海洋中。




LICHTENBERG FIGURES
An electrical discharge passing through a solid block of transparent material can leave a trace of its lightninglike path as it cracks the material. Sometimes,dust or fragments attracted electrically to the crack surface make the structure more visible. These patterns are named after the eighteenthcentury German scientist who first described them.

9 SPOTS & STRIPES
How the zebra paints its coat

斑马如何涂上外套

Rudyard Kipling explained in his Just So Stories how the leopard got its spots and the zebra its stripes. His answers were wholly fanciful, but at that time scientists could do little better. It was one thing to explain why animals have markings—for camouflage, for example—but quite another to explain how that comes about as the creature grows. The explanation now widely accepted is that these patterns are produced in a process of self-organization that also operates in very different kinds of natural phenomena. It finds analogies in the way sand ripples form or animals arrange their nests in colonies. In other words the description is, in the end, a mathematical one that doesn’t depend on biological particulars, even if it is adapted and fine-tuned by natural selection.
吉卜林在他的故事中解释了豹是如何获得斑点和斑马条纹的。他的回答完全是荒诞不经的，但那时科学家们做得更好。例如，解释动物为什么有伪装的标记是一回事，但解释动物生长的原因是另一回事。现在广泛接受的解释是，这些模式是在自组织的过程中产生的，它们也以非常不同的自然现象运作。它发现类比的方式，沙波纹形成或动物安排他们的巢在殖民地。换句话说，描述的是，在最后，一个数学一个不依赖于生物的细节，即使是适应和自然选择的调整好。

Animals are exquisite masters of pattern, but they seem to follow particular fashions. The stripes of the zebra are a popular design: as you’d guess, the zebrafish has the same idea, and so does the angelfish, the tiger, some antelopes, frogs, caterpillars, and other creatures. Another favorite is spots, sported by the leopard, the spotted eagle ray, the ladybird, and the red spotted toad. Butterflies seem to recognize no limits: their patterns are dazzling, sumptuous, and seemingly endless.
It’s not always easy to say what these patterns are for. The usual assumption among biologists and zoologists is that, if evolution has gone to the trouble of making an animal patterned, there’s a reason for it that somehow works to the animal’s advantage: in other words, it is a Darwinian adaptation that helps the creature to survive and therefore to reproduce. Maybe it’s a warning signal to fool or deter predators. Or perhaps it helps members of the same species to recognize each other, or to impress the opposite sex in mating displays.
But although it seems likely that most markings do have an adaptive function like this,we can’t always be sure what that function is.
动物是图案的精湛大师，但它们似乎遵循着特定的时尚。斑马条纹是一种流行的设计：正如你猜的那样，斑马鱼有着同样的想法，天使鱼、老虎、羚羊、青蛙、毛毛虫和其他生物也是如此。另一个喜欢的是斑点，被豹、斑点鹰射线、瓢虫和红斑点蟾蜍所感染。蝴蝶似乎没有任何限制：它们的图案是耀眼的，华丽的，似乎无止境的。
说这些模式的目的并不总是很容易。生物学家和动物学家的通常假设是，如果进化到了使动物图案化的麻烦，有一个原因，它对动物的优势起作用：换句话说，这是达尔文适应，帮助生物生存，因此T。复制。也许这是一种愚弄或阻止捕食者的警告信号。或许它可以帮助同一物种的成员认识对方，或者在交配展示中给异性留下深刻印象。
但是，尽管大多数标记似乎都具有这样的自适应函数，但我们不能总是确定该函数是什么。

Evolutionary “explanations” for markings may come all too easily; evidence for them is harder. Take the zebra. It seems obvious that the stripes must help it to hide in the shadows, right?
But zebras spend most of their time on open grassland, not among trees and bushes. And if stripes help you hide from predators like lions,why don’t all their prey have them? The zebra’s stripes might not be a form of camouflage at all, but could deter biting flies, or regulate body heat,or something else. We just don’t know. It’s the same story with wild cats; it’s true that there are more spotty and mottled ones in habitats that create a mottled, patchy background, but there are exceptions, too.
And even if these patterns on skins, pelts, and scales do have some evolutionary function, that doesn’t completely answer the question of where they come from. How does any particular zebra embryo get imprinted with stripes of pigmentproducing skin cells, which produce dark hairs in some places but not in others? Until half a century ago, we had no idea. But now we do—for spots and stripes can be created by clever chemistry.
对标记的进化“解释”可能太容易了；对它们的证据更难。以斑马为例。显然，条纹必须帮助它隐藏在阴影中，对吧？
但是斑马大部分时间都呆在开阔的草地上，而不是在树和灌木丛中。如果条纹可以帮助你躲避像狮子这样的掠食者，为什么它们的猎物不都有它们呢？斑马的条纹可能不是伪装的形式，但可以阻止咬苍蝇，或调节体温，或其他东西。我们只是不知道。野生猫科动物的故事也是一样的，在生境中有更多的斑点和斑驳的斑点，会产生斑驳斑驳的背景，但也有例外。
即使皮肤、皮毛和鳞片上的这些图案确实具有某种进化功能，但它们并不能完全回答它们来自何处的问题。任何特定斑马胚胎如何印有条纹产生色素的皮肤细胞，在某些地方产生黑头发，而不是在其他地方产生黑头发？直到半个世纪前，我们还不知道。但现在我们要做的是斑点和条纹可以用巧妙的化学方法创造出来。

Breaking out in pattern
The British mathematician Alan Turing offered the first theory of how animal patterns are formed.
Turing is best known for his work on the notion of programmable computers and for his codebreaking exploits for the Allies at Bletchley Park during World War II, now made famous by the movie The Imitation Game. But his inquisitive mind took him down all kinds of paths, and in 1952 he described a theory of how embryos develop from a simple, spherical egg into a patterned body with organs and limbs. That question led Turing to discover one of the most lovely and versatile patterning processes in nature.
Turing imagined the embryo as a ball of cells full of biochemical ingredients that are drifting through the cell liquid and reacting with each other to turn on or off genes that control how particular cells will develop. He showed how such a soup of chemicals could spontaneously lose the blandness of a uniform mixture and adopt a patchy structure, with more of certain ingredients in some places than in others.
模式突破
英国数学家Alan Turing提出了动物模式形成的第一个理论。
图灵最著名的是他对可编程计算机概念的研究，以及他在二战期间在布莱切利公园的盟军破坏者的发明，现在这部电影以模仿游戏闻名。但是他好奇的头脑让他走上了各种各样的道路，1952他描述了一个理论，即胚胎是如何从一个简单的球形蛋发展成具有器官和四肢的有图案的身体。这个问题导致图灵发现了自然界中最可爱和多用途的图解过程之一。
图灵把胚胎想象成一个充满生化成分的细胞球，它们通过细胞液体漂流并相互反应，打开或关闭控制特定细胞发育的基因。他展示了这样的化学汤如何会自发地失去均匀混合物的平淡，并采用一种斑驳的结构，在某些地方比其他地方含有更多的成分。


The key is feedback. What if, Turing said, some chemical reactions make substances that speed up the reaction that actually produces them—if they are, in other words, auto-catalysts? This can create a runaway effect, in which tiny, chance fluctuations in the concentration of the ingredients can become blown up into big differences, so that the mixture becomes spontaneously patchy.
On their own, auto-catalysts would multiply until they overwhelm the whole mixture. But in Turing’s soup there were two kinds of ingredients, which he called morphogens (“shape formers”). Today researchers call one of these an activator, since it is auto-catalytic and boosts its own production,and the other an inhibitor, since it suppresses this self-amplifying growth of the activator. Molecules of the two components spread through the mixture like ink in water, but in Turing’s scheme the inhibitor spreads faster than the activator. When he wrote down and solved the equations describing this activator-inhibitor scheme, Turing found that blobs of activator may grow in some places, more or less at random, but constrained within little islands, separated by the effect of the inhibitor. He remarked that they looked like the dappled markings on some animals. Later, when Turing’s equations could be solved by computer, it became clear that they generally produce two types of pattern: arrays of spots and stripes, all about the same size and spaced by the same distance, and arranged in a more or less orderly fashion. We now know that Turing’s chemical patterns are a variation on the reaction-diffusion schemes described in Chapter 5, which generate chemical waves. In Turing’s theory, the waves are “frozen” in place; they are stationary.
关键是反馈。如果Turing说，有些化学反应会使物质加速反应，如果它们是自动催化剂的话，会产生什么样的反应？这会产生一种失控的效应，在这种情况下，成分浓度的微小波动会被吹成大的差异，从而使混合物自发地变得片状。
就其自身而言，汽车催化剂会不断增加，直到它们压垮整个混合物。但在图灵汤中，有两种成分，他称之为形态发生素（“形状成型器”）。今天，研究人员将其中的一种称为活化剂，因为它是自动催化和促进自身生产的，而另一种是抑制剂，因为它抑制了激活剂的这种自放大生长。两种组分的分子在水中像油墨一样扩散，但在图灵的方案中，抑制剂比活化剂扩散得快。当他写下了描述这种激活物抑制剂方案的方程，图灵发现斑点激活可能在某些地方生长，或多或少随意，但限制在小小的岛屿，由抑制剂的分离效果。他说，他们喜欢看一些动物斑纹的标记。后来，当图灵方程式可以由计算机来解决，它变得清晰，他们普遍产生的两种模式：斑点和条纹阵列，大小差不多，间隔相同的距离，排列在或多或少有序。我们现在知道，图灵的化学模式是对5章所述的反应扩散方案的变化，产生化学波。在图灵的理论，这波“冻结”的地方；他们是静止的。

Whether or not Turing’s theory told us anything about how embryos grow, it seemed to offer a good explanation for how animal markings—the spots of the leopard and the stripes of a zebra—form. The idea is that there are biochemical morphogens produced in the skins of these creatures as they develop in the womb, which drift from cell to cell acting like Turing’s activator and inhibitor. Where there’s a lot of the activator, it can throw a genetic switch to turn on pigment production, and the pattern gets laid down in the embryo. As the animal grows, the pattern expands.
It wasn’t until 1990 that researchers in France succeeded in making Turing patterns experimentally in a mixture of chemicals. Today there are various chemical recipes for making a wide range of Turing patterns based on spots and stripes. Some are almost crystallike in their regularity, while others are fabulous jumbled labyrinths. With some care in arranging the initial distribution of the activator and inhibitor, you can make a vast galaxy of different patterns.
无论图灵的理论是否告诉我们胚胎如何生长，它似乎提供了一个很好的解释，说明动物的斑纹和斑马的斑纹是如何形成的。这个想法是，这些生物在皮肤中产生的生化形态发生在子宫中，它们从细胞迁移到细胞，就像Turing的激活剂和抑制剂一样。在有很多激活剂的情况下，它可以引发一个基因开关来开启色素产生，而这种模式在胚胎中形成。随着动物的生长，图案扩张。
直到1990，法国的研究人员才成功地在化学混合物中制作图灵图案。今天有各种各样的化学配方，用于制作基于斑点和条纹的图灵图案。有些在其规律性上几乎是晶体状的，而另一些则是错综复杂的迷宫。在安排激活剂和抑制剂的初始分布时要注意，你可以形成一个巨大的不同模式的星系。

Animal tales
Since the 1980s, researchers have shown how mathematical models of biochemical pigment patterning using Turing’s ideas can produce the variety of markings we see in real animals. Zebrastyle stripes are fairly easy to make, but many markings are more complicated. The leopard’s spots, for example, are a little like clusters of fingerprints—not a single dark splodge, but groups of perhaps four or five blobs arranged like black petals around a central brownish patch. The jaguar’s spots are still more complex: dark rings with a few little blobs in the center. And the giraffe doesn’t so much have dark spots as an entirely dark pelt threaded by a network of unpigmented hairs, a bit like the pattern of cracks in dry mud.
这些动物
researchers have shown the 1980s以来，如何利用数学模型对生化颜料patterning图灵的想法，可以产生markings in the variety of我们看到真实的动物。如果您发现有错误，请尽管发表评论！The leopard ' s spos，for example，are a little like like chlusters of fingeirley - not a single dark splodge，but groups of perhaps four or five blobs arranged like black petals around a central Brownish Patch .美洲豹的斑点are still more complex with a few：暗环的小斑点，in the中心。and the长颈鹿不那么暗斑有黑暗的毛皮as an entirely by a Network of线程无颜料的头发，点像in the pattern of精锐干泥。

With a bit of ingenuity, all of these patterns can be generated by Turing-type activatorinhibitor processes, although sometimes they need more than two ingredients. What’s more, these mathematical models can explain how the patterns depend on the shapes of the bodies they cover. Spots on a large patch of fur, for example, might turn into stripelike bands on a tapering tail, as they do for some wildcats. Whether ladybird species have spots or stripes, and how big they are, may depend on how curved their domelike wing-covering shells are. And the mathematical models can mimic the kind of “unzipping” of stripes seen on the angelfish as it grows.
有一点独创性，所有这些模式都可以由图灵型Ac激活抑制器过程生成，尽管有时它们需要多于两种成分。更重要的是，这些数学模型可以解释模式如何取决于它们所覆盖的物体的形状。例如，在一大块毛皮上的斑点可能会变成尾巴上的条纹状带，就像一些野猫一样。瓢虫物种是否有斑点或条纹，以及它们有多大，可能取决于它们的穹顶状翅膀覆盖的壳是多么弯曲。数学模型可以模拟天使鱼在生长时看到的条纹的“解压缩”。

After reading Turing’s paper on chemical patterns, the eminent biologist Conrad Waddington wrote to Turing to suggest that his theory might explain butterfly wing patterns. With their array of spots, stripes, chevrons, and other shapes, they seem like an obvious candidate.
But it now appears that the process here is more complicated, involving a delicate interplay between diffusing biochemicals that act rather like morphogens, the vein structure of the wings themselves, and the complex genetic mechanisms that control the organism’s development. In other words, they aren’t exactly Turing patterns, but they are probably related. The idea is that the butterfly wing contains various “sources” and “sinks” of the morphogens— places where they are produced and destroyed, ultimately controlled by “patterning genes.” Depending on how these sources and sinks are arranged, all the common pattern elements in butterfly wings can be mimicked in mathematical models.
在阅读图灵关于化学图案的论文之后，杰出的生物学家Conrad Waddington写信给图灵，建议他的理论可以解释蝴蝶翅膀的图案。他们的斑点，条纹，雪佛龙和其他形状，他们似乎是一个明显的候选人。
但现在看来，这里的过程更为复杂，涉及扩散的生物化学物质之间的微妙相互作用，其作用相当于形态发生素、翅膀自身的静脉结构以及控制生物体发育的复杂遗传机制。换句话说，它们不是精确的图灵图案，但它们可能是相关的。蝴蝶翅膀中含有各种各样的“源”和“下沉”的形态发生——它们被产生和破坏的地方，最终被“图案化基因控制”。翅膀可以模仿数学模型。


All this is a good sign that Turing’s process for producing animal markings is on the right track, but it’s not yet proof that the idea is right.
To prove it, we would need to find the actual biochemicals that act as morphogens of pattern formation. No one has yet managed to do that for pigment patterns. There is, however, pretty good evidence that several other biological patterns are made by the same kind of activator-inhibitor process: for example, the regularly spaced hair follicles of mice (and perhaps ours, too), the series of parallel barbs in bird feathers, the dunelike ridges in the mouth palate of mammals,and the stripelike segmentation of hands and feet in mammal embryos that leads eventually to the formation of the fingers and toes. It’s possible that something like a Turing process of reaction and diffusion of morphogens happens in plants, too, where it might produce the regular arrangements of leaves around a stem or florets and seeds in a flower head (see Chapter 3). That’s a possibility that Turing himself foresaw.
And Turing’s patterns might reach further still, into whole communities of organisms. The basic ingredients are, after all, quite simple: you need a process that amplifies itself by positive feedback and another process that inhibits this, both of which must spread throughout the system at different rates. Given these elements, the patterns that emerge are likely to be more or less the same in every case. In the semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, you can find grass covering the dry ground in labyrinthine patches that look like the convoluted designs seen on some fish.
所有这一切都表明图灵生产动物标识的过程是正确的，但还不能证明这个想法是正确的。
为了证明这一点，我们需要找到作为模式形成的形态发生的实际生物化学物质。至今还没有人能做到这一点的颜料图案。然而，很好的证据表明，其他几种生物模式是由同一种活化剂抑制剂过程所产生的：例如，老鼠（也可能是我们的）的规则间隔的毛囊，在鸟类羽毛中的一系列平行倒刺，嘴里的沙丘状脊。哺乳动物的腭，哺乳动物胚胎中手足的条纹状分裂，最终导致手指和脚趾的形成。在植物中也可能发生类似于图灵反应和扩散的图灵过程，在那里它可能产生围绕茎或小花的叶子的排列，并在花头中产生种子（见第3章）。这是图灵自己预见的可能性。
图灵的模式可能会进一步深入到整个生物群落中。毕竟，基本的成分很简单：你需要一个通过正反馈放大自身的过程和另一个抑制这一过程的过程，这两个过程都必须以不同的速率在整个系统中传播。考虑到这些因素，出现的模式在每种情况下或多或少都是相同的。在非洲和中东的半干旱地区，你可以发现在干燥的土地上覆盖着迷宫般的斑块，就像一些鱼上看到的卷曲的图案。

The grassy patches are sustained by their ability to capture the water flowing over the land after rare bursts of rain: a clump of grass can accumulate run-off water at the cost of depriving the ground around it. A mathematical model of this process suggests that on sloping ground where the flow goes one way, the result should be stripes of vegetation, whereas on flat ground the flow is controlled more by random little topographical bumps and the pattern is more spotty. These models also predict—and observations of nature seem to confirm it—that the pattern can change from spots to interweaving stripes to carpets punctured by holes of bare ground, as the amount of rainfall increases.
草地上的斑块是由它们捕捉罕见雨水后在陆地上流动的水的能力来维持的：一丛草可以以消耗掉周围的土地为代价来积聚径流水。这一过程的数学模型表明，在坡面上的流动是单向的，结果应该是植被条带，而在平坦的地面上，流动受到随机的小地形凸起更多的控制，并且图案更加斑点。这些模型还预测和观察自然，似乎可以证实，随着降雨量的增加，图案可以从斑点到交织的条纹变为被裸露地面孔刺破的地毯。

BODY MATH
This Christmas tree worm (Spirobranchus gigantus), a marine spirochaete found in tropical oceans,has a body plan of ornate yet almost mathematically regular design. How does such organized structure arise in a living organism?
身体数学
在热带海洋中发现的一种海洋螺旋体，这种圣诞树蠕虫有一个华丽而几乎在数学上有规律的设计。这种有组织的结构是如何在生物体中出现的？


The self-organized world
Turing’s theory has been proposed as an explanation for patterns as diverse as the arrangement of “ant cemeteries” (where ants deposit the dead bodies of their peers), the arrangements of sand ripples in deserts, and the patchiness of plankton communities in the oceans and of crime incidence in cities. It seems likely to be one of nature’s universal principles for converting bland uniformity to interesting, sometimes useful, often beautiful patchiness. It’s not too fanciful to say that it is a means by which nature exercises her creativity.
And it’s a classic example of self-organization: how a system consisting of many components all interacting with one another according to some generally simple rules can become spontaneously structured into a complex design. In Turing’s original theory these components were the morphogen molecules, which move around and react with each other. But they can also be grains of sand, plants and water, entire animals. So while Turing wrote down his theory in terms of equations that described what was happening to the morphogens everywhere, all at once, each component of the system really only needs to “know” about its own local environment: all it sees are its neighbors, and all it does is follow the rules in interacting with them. One particular set of interaction rules produces the static patterns that Turing described.
自组织世界
图灵的理论被认为是对“蚁坟”（蚂蚁在其同伴体内沉积尸体）、沙漠中沙波的排列以及海洋中浮游生物群落的斑块和犯罪发生率的解释。在城市里。这似乎是自然界的普遍原则之一，它把平淡的统一转换成有趣的、有时有用的、通常是美丽的斑块。说这是大自然发挥创造力的一种手段，这并不太奇怪。
这是一个典型的自组织例子：一个由许多组件组成的系统如何根据一些简单的规则彼此交互，可以自发地构造成一个复杂的设计。在图灵的原始理论中，这些成分是形态发生分子，它们围绕着彼此移动和反应。但它们也可以是沙粒，植物和水，整个动物。因此，当图灵用描述所有形态发生的方程式的理论写下他的理论时，系统的每个组成部分只需要“了解”它自己的本地环境：它所看到的只是它的邻居，它所做的只是遵循规则I。与他们互动。一组特定的交互规则产生图灵所描述的静态模式。

Other rules can give different structures, such as the flocking motions of birds and fish.
This seems to be how much of biology works, whether at the level of molecules interacting to build a creature or of whole communities of such creatures building their habitat. By using chemical pheromones and other signals, for example, termites coordinate with one another to construct towering nests out of mud and spittle, taller in relative terms than our own skyscrapers, and laced with chambers for the queen and her eggs, “gardens” for growing fungal food, and passageways that allow for ventilation. No one plans these edifices; they “build themselves” as each termite labors away on its own little part.

We, too, do this; our cities are best considered as organisms or ecosystems themselves, with their own metabolism, transport networks, and patterns.
No one, on the whole, plans them; they have an organic vitality, but they can also sicken and decay. That’s why we need to understand selforganization: it’s what we depend on.
其他规则可以给出不同的结构，例如鸟和鱼的植绒运动。
这似乎是多少生物的工作，无论是在分子水平的相互作用，以建立一个生物或整个社区的这种生物建立自己的栖息地。例如，通过使用化学信息素和其他信号，白蚁相互协调，从泥泞和唾沫中筑起高耸的巢穴，比我们自己的摩天大楼更高，并为女王和她的蛋绑上了腔室，“花园”用于生长真菌食物，和PAS。允许通风的通道。没有人计划这些建筑，它们“自建”，因为每一只白蚁都在自己的小部分上劳作。
我们也这样做，我们的城市最好被视为生物或生态系统本身，有他们自己的新陈代谢，运输网络和模式。
总的来说，没有人计划他们，他们有一个有机的生命力，但他们也会生病和衰败。这就是为什么我们需要理解自我组织：这是我们赖以生存的。




STRIPES
One of nature’s universal marking patterns, seen here in an Indo-Pacific sea anemone (1) and a herd of Burchell’s zebras (2)
条纹
自然界中普遍存在的一种标记图案，在印度洋太平洋海葵（1）和伯切尔斑马群（2）中可见。




MARKED FOR LIFE
Pelt pigmentation on large mammals comes in a range of patterns, from spots and stripes to rosettes and polygonal networks. But all may stem from the same basic biochemical patterning process.
标志生命
在大型哺乳动物上的色素沉着有一系列的模式，从斑点和条纹到玫瑰花结和多边形网络。但所有这些都源于同一个基本的生化图案化过程。



THE DETAILS MATTER
Even creatures as small as dragonflies may be decorated with intricate patterns. Often these enhance the creature’s visibility, and seem to have a role in courtship and mating.
细节问题
甚至像蜻蜓一样小的生物也可以用复杂的图案装饰。这些通常增强了生物的能见度，并且似乎在求偶和交配中起作用。


THE ART OF PLUMAGE
Bird feather patterns are among the most glorious displays in nature.
Some of the colors here, especially the greens and blues, are not created by pigments, but by microscopic, regular structures in the barbs that reflect light of particular wavelengths—rather like the tiny ridges of butterfly wing scales. The colors are established during feather growth, before the nascent feather gets divided up into separate barbs, so that the pattern is continuous from one barb to the next. The regularly spaced rows of barbs are themselves also thought to be produced in a biochemical patterning process.
羽毛艺术
鸟类羽毛图案是自然界中最绚丽的表现形式之一。
这里的一些颜色，特别是绿色和蓝色，不是由颜料产生的，而是由微小的，规则的结构在倒刺中反射特定波长的光，就像蝴蝶翅膀鳞片的小脊。颜色是在羽毛生长过程中形成的，在新生羽毛被分成单独的倒钩之前，这样图案从一个倒刺到另一个倒刺。规则排列的倒刺排本身也被认为是在生化图案化过程中产生的。







OFF THE SCALE
Reptiles and amphibians can sport particularly colorful markings. Some are picked out,pointillist style, in different-colored scales, as on some snake skins. Note that the underlying texture of the “canvas” is also characterized by a regular, almost geometric pattern: the polygonal divisions of a  turtle shell, the tilelike arrays of scales, the warty bumps of a chameleon’s skin.
偏离规模
爬行动物和两栖动物可以运动特别多彩的标记。有些是挑选出来的，点缀式的，在不同颜色的鳞片上，如在一些蛇皮上。注意，“帆布”的底层纹理也有一个规则的、几乎是几何的图案：龟壳的多边形分割、鳞片的叶状排列、变色龙皮肤的凹凸不平的凸起。




ON THE WING
Butterflies (and sometimes their caterpillar precursors) make inventive use of a small palette of pattern elements, such as eyespots, chevrons, stripes, and outlinings of veins. These are rearranged to suit many purposes—for example, warnings to deter predators, camouflage, mimicry, and species recognition.
在机翼上
蝴蝶（有时他们的卡特彼勒前身）创造性地使用了一个小图案的调色板，比如眼罩、雪佛龙、条纹和静脉外露。这些被重新排列以适应许多目的，例如警告阻止捕食者、伪装、模仿和物种识别。



AGAIN AND AGAIN
Many insects have segmented bodies; on each segment a particular pattern might be repeated more or less identically.
一次又一次
许多昆虫都有分段的身体；在每一个片段上，一个特定的图案可能或多或少相同地重复。

BENT INTO SHAPE
The chemical patterning process outlined by Alan Turing seems likely to underpin beetle and weevil markings, where it observes precise bilateral mirror symmetry. These patterns seem to be constrained and shaped by the small size and the curvature of the carapace.
弯曲成形
Alan Turing所概述的化学图案化过程似乎有助于甲虫和象鼻虫标记，其中观察到精确的双侧镜像对称性。这些图案似乎受到小尺寸和甲壳曲率的限制和塑造。



CONSTELLATIONS OF THE SEAS
Anemones and corals show a rich variety of shape, pattern, marking, and texture. Some of the regularity is produced by wrinkling and buckling during growth, some is precisely specified in the body shape by genetic instructions, and some comes from selforganization of the pigmentation.
海洋星座
银莲花和珊瑚具有丰富的形状、图案、标记和纹理。一些规律性是由生长过程中的褶皱和屈曲产生的，有些是通过遗传指令精确地在身体形状中指定的，有些来自色素沉着的自组织化。



SUBMARINE RAINBOWS
The markings on fish typify the generic spots and stripes of Turing patterns, although these may be elaborated or modified into more flamboyant designs.
海底彩虹
鱼上的标记代表图灵图案的一般斑点和条纹，尽管这些图案可以被阐述或修改成更华丽的图案。



DEEP DESIGNS
Some markings on fish are highly orderly, such as that of the emperor angelfish (1). But the pattern produced by a single Turing-type biochemical process might change as the boundaries of the “canvas” change, so that, for example, stripes might break up into spotty markings at an edge (3). Some of these marking patterns continue to develop and shift as the fish grows, so that more stripes appear rather than a fixed pattern just expanding with increasing body size. That’s what happens, for example, for the angelfish (1 and 2).
深层设计
鱼上的一些标记是高度有序的，比如皇帝神仙鱼（1）。但是，一个图灵型生化过程所产生的图案可能随着“画布”的边界改变而改变，因此，例如，条纹可能在边缘（3）中分裂成斑点状的标记。一些标记图案随着鱼的生长而不断发展和变化，因此更多的条纹出现而不是固定的图案，只是随着体型的增大而扩展。这就是发生的事情，例如，天使鱼（1和2）。


MERGING ISLANDS
The skin of the leopard sea cucumber is marked by roughly circular islands that may merge via narrow necks if they are close enough—looking like cartoons of dividing cells. The black borders, bright “coastal waters,” and superimposed eyespots make this pattern seem all the more surreal, like the map of a strange,crater-pocked planetary surface.
合并岛屿
豹纹海参的皮肤是由大致圆形的岛屿标记的，如果它们足够接近，看起来像分裂细胞的卡通图案，那么它们可以通过狭窄的脖子合并。黑色的边界，明亮的“沿海水域”和重叠的眼点使这种模式看起来更加离奇，就像一个奇怪的，坑坑的行星表面的地图。

CHEMICAL MAZE
These patterns, produced in a Turing-type mixture of chemical reagents, constantly grow, shift, merge, and change like replicating organisms, their precise shapes and forms dependent on the exact conditions of the reaction.
化学迷宫
这些模式，在图灵型化学试剂混合物中产生，不断地生长、移位、合并和改变，如复制生物体，它们的精确形状和形式取决于反应的确切条件。


BLOOMING LOVELY
Leaves and flowers may be decorated with pigmentation, often to make them more visible to pollinating insects. The resemblance to bird plumage is explicitly acknowledged in the name of the bird of paradise plant (1).
可爱的盛开
叶和花可以用色素沉着来装饰，通常使它们对传粉昆虫更加可见。鸟类羽毛的相似性是以天堂鸟（1）的名义明确承认的。





BANDING TOGETHER
Is nature more beautiful than it “needs” to be? It is hard to find an adaptive explanation for the richness of rainbow banding of this spiderwort plant (1), while the banding in bracket fungi (2) is simply an accidental result of its periodic spells of growth, not unlike the growth rings of a tree. As the zoologist D’Arcy Thompson pointed out, some things in nature look the way they do simply because of the details of how they got to be that way: form becomes a frozen memory of growth.
捆扎在一起
自然比它“需要”更美吗？很难找到一种适应性解释这种蜘蛛纲植物的彩虹带丰富度（1），而在托架真菌中的带状（2）只是它周期性生长的偶然结果，与树的生长环不同。正如动物学家D'ARCY汤普森指出的那样，自然界中的一些事物仅仅是因为它们是如何成为这样的细节而形成的：形式变成了对生长的冻结记忆。






Glossary
Activator-inhibitor system
A pattern-forming system proposed in 1952 by Alan Turing, in which two (or more) patterning influences interact to produce patchiness, such as spots or stripes.

Convection
Movement of a fluid (a liquid or gas) usually caused by differences in density—which in turn often result from differences in temperature throughout the fluid.

Fractal
A structure or object whose shape repeats at ever finer scales.

Kármán vortex street
A regular train of vortices in a fluid flow, typically caused when the flow has to pass around some obstruction.

Logarithmic spiral
A spiral that gets “wider” with increasing distance from the center. (Strictly speaking, this spiral is a curve described by a particular mathematical equation involving logarithms.)

Phyllotaxis
The arrangement of leaves, petals, or other parts on a plant stem.

Periodic minimal surface
A surface that extends throughout threedimensional space with zero mean curvature:the “positive” and “negative” curvature of the convolutions cancel out. The surface is generally labyrinthine, with a shape that repeats again and again (is periodic), like a crystal.

Quasicrystal
A material in which the atoms are arranged in a pattern that, while never quite repeating exactly, nevertheless is orderly enough to generate sharp “crystal-like” spots in X-ray diffraction. This pattern seems to imply that the material has a “forbidden” symmetry, such as five- or eightfold.

Reaction-diffusion process
A process that involves some kind of reaction between, or combination of, its components, while they move around by random diffusion.
Such systems may generate a variety of patterns,such as moving waves or stationary patches.

Symmetry breaking
The switch from a high to a lower degree of symmetry in a system—as, for example, when a perfectly uniform system develops a pattern,which makes some directions in space different from others.

Self-organization
A process of patterning or organization arising solely from the interactions between the components of a system, rather than being imposed by some outside influence.

Self-similarity
The property in which a small part of an object looks like its whole—as, for example, with the branches of a tree. This is a typical property of fractals.

Turbulence
A state of fluid flow that is chaotic: it is impossible to fully predict, from the flow structure at one particular time, what the flow will look like at some later time. Although turbulent flow looks disorderly, some relatively orderly structures such as vortices may come and go. All flows are expected to become turbulent when they are fast enough.

Further reading

The ideas in this book are explored in more detail in my trilogy Nature’s Patterns: Shapes, Flow, and Branches 【藏书】(Oxford University Press, 2009). Those books in turn arose from an updating of The SelfMade Tapestry (Oxford University Press, 1999).
Excellent general surveys of spontaneous pattern formation in science and nature are also provided by Ian Stewart in What Shape is a Snowflake? (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2001)and Fearful Symmetry (with Martin Golubitsky,Penguin, 1993). Nice discussions of some of the biological aspects of pattern formation can be found in Brian Goodwin’s How the Leopard Changed its Spots (Princeton University Press,2001), and in Goodwin’s rather more technical collaboration with Ricard Solé, Signs of Life (Basic Books, 2000).
Even though a great deal has changed over the course of a century, nothing has diminished the scope, vision, and elegance of D’Arcy Thompson’s 1917 classic On Growth and Form, available unabridged in a 1992 Dover edition. The abridged 1961 edition published by Cambridge University Press might be less daunting for some.
And for a visual feast, it is still hard to beat (and sadly, equally hard to procure) Peter Stevens’ Patterns in Nature (Little Brown, 1979).
这本书中的思想在我的三部曲的自然模式中更详细地探究：形状、流动和分支。（牛津大学出版社，2009）。这些书又源于自编挂毯的更新（牛津大学出版社，1999）。
Ian Stewart在科学和自然中的自发模式形成的一般性调查也提供了雪花的形状？（韦登菲尔德和尼科尔森，2001）和可怕的对称性（与Martin Golubitsky，企鹅，1993）。在Brian Goodwin的《豹如何改变斑点》（普林斯顿大学出版社，2001）和古德温与里卡德•索莱的技术合作（生活基础）中，发现了一些模式形成的生物学方面的好的讨论（基础书籍，2000）。
尽管在一个世纪的过程中已经发生了很大的变化，但没有任何东西缩小了汤普森的1917个关于增长和形式的经典，在1992多佛版中没有删节。剑桥大学出版社出版的删节1961版可能不会让人感到畏惧。
对于一个视觉盛宴，仍然很难击败（同样，很难获得）Peter Stevens的自然模式（Little Brown，1979）。
