Introduction

The world is a confusing and turbulent place, but we make sense of it by finding order. We notice the regular cycles of day and night, the waxing and waning of the moon and tides, and the recurrence of the seasons. We look for similarity, predictability, regularity: those have always been the guiding principles behind the emergence of science. We try to break down the complex profusion of nature into simple rules, to find order among what might at first look like chaos. This makes us all pattern seekers.

    介绍
    世界是一个混乱而令人困惑的地方，但我们总试图找出秩序来理解它。我们观察到昼夜的交替变化，月亮的盈亏和潮汐的涨落的关系，以及季节周而复始的重现。我们在寻找其中的相似性、可预测性和规律性：那些一直隐藏在（自然）现象背后的科学规律。我们试图把大量复杂的自然现象分解成简单的部分，并在最初看起来像混沌的事物中寻找秩序。这使我们都成为模式的搜寻者。`【我们试图发现复杂自然现象背后的简单模式。】`

It's a habit hardwired into our brains. From a baby's first inklings of repeated sounds and experiences, recognizing pattern and regularity  helps us to survive and make our way in the world. Patterns are the daily bread of scientists,but anyone can appreciate them, and respond to them with delight and wonder as well as with aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. Just about every culture on earth, from the ancient Egyptians to Native Americans and Australian Aborigines,has decorated its artifacts with regular patterns.
It seems that we find these structures not only pleasing but also reassuring, as if they help us believe that, no matter what fate brings, there is a logic and order behind it all.

    这是一种我们大脑（潜意识）的习惯。从婴儿第一次反复听到的声音和经验中，认识到模式和规律有助于我们生存并走进世界。模式是科学家们的一日三餐，但任何人也都能领会它们，并从中获取愉悦而惊奇的审美和智力快感。几乎所有地球文明，从古埃及人到美洲土著及澳大利亚土著，都用规则的图形（模式）来装饰他们的（史前）器物。
    这些图形图案似乎不仅让我们愉悦，而且令人安心，好像它们使我们相信，不管命运如何，其背后都隐藏着逻辑和秩序。
