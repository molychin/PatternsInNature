Introduction

The world is a confusing and turbulent place, but we make sense of it by finding order. We notice the regular cycles of day and night, the waxing and waning of the moon and tides, and the recurrence of the seasons. We look for similarity, predictability, regularity: those have always been the guiding principles behind the emergence of science. We try to break down the complex profusion of nature into simple rules, to find order among what might at first look like chaos. This makes us all pattern seekers.

介绍    
世界是一个混乱而令人困惑的地方，但我们总试图找出秩序来理解它。我们观察到昼夜的交替变化，月亮的盈亏和潮汐的涨落的关系，以及季节周而复始的重现。我们在寻找其中的相似性、可预测性和规律性：那些一直隐藏在（自然）现象背后的科学规律。我们试图把大量复杂的自然现象分解成简单的部分，并在最初看起来像混沌的事物中寻找秩序。这使我们都成为模式的搜寻者。`【我们试图发现复杂自然现象背后的简单模式。】`

It's a habit hardwired into our brains. From a baby's first inklings of repeated sounds and experiences, recognizing pattern and regularity  helps us to survive and make our way in the world. Patterns are the daily bread of scientists,but anyone can appreciate them, and respond to them with delight and wonder as well as with aesthetic and intellectual satisfaction. Just about every culture on earth, from the ancient Egyptians to Native Americans and Australian Aborigines,has decorated its artifacts with regular patterns.
It seems that we find these structures not only pleasing but also reassuring, as if they help us believe that, no matter what fate brings, there is a logic and order behind it all.

这是一种我们大脑（潜意识）的习惯。从婴儿第一次反复听到的声音和经验中，认识到模式和规律有助于我们生存并走进世界。模式是科学家们的一日三餐，但任何人也都能领会它们，并从中获取愉悦而惊奇的审美和智力快感。几乎所有地球文明，从古埃及人到美洲土著及澳大利亚土著，都用规则的图形（模式）来装饰他们的（史前）器物。    
这些图形图案似乎不仅让我们愉悦，而且令人安心，好像它们使我们相信，不管命运如何，其背后都隐藏着逻辑和秩序。

But when we make our own patterns, it is through careful planning and construction, with each individual element cut to shape and laid in place, or woven one at a time into the fabric.
The message seems to be that making a pattern requires a patterner. That's why, when people in former times recognized patterns in nature—the bee’s honeycomb, animal markings, the spiraling of seeds in a sunflower head, the six-pointed star of a snowflake—they imagined it to be the fingerprint of intelligent design, a sign left by some omnipotent creator in his handiwork.

当我们制定自己的（图案）模式，往往需要通过仔细地规划和构造，每个独立的部件切割成形，放置在合适的位置，或及时地编织成一个整体。  
这看起来必须要有个设计师来设计这些模式。正因为如此，当人们在自然界中看到例如蜜蜂的蜂巢、动物痕迹、向日葵头部种子排列的螺旋状、雪花的六尖星时，他们认为这些是智能设计的证明，必然是有一个万能创造者（上帝）留下他的手工制品。

Today, we don’t need that hypothesis. It’s clear that pattern, regularity, and form can arise from the basic forces and principles of physics and chemistry, perhaps selected and refined by the exigencies of biological evolution. But that only deepens the mystery. How does the intricate tapestry of nature contrive to organize itself, producing a pattern without any blueprint or foresight? How do these patterns form spontaneously? 

但今天，我们并不需要这个（上帝存在的）假设。很明显，（图案）模式、规律和（结构）形式都可以从物理和化学基本原理和规则中产生，也许所有这些都可以通过生物进化的迫切性来选择和提炼。但这样说只会加深神秘感，自然又如何在没有先见和蓝图的情况下，自行完成这些错综复杂的设计而呈现可见的模式？

There are clues in how they look. Perhaps the most curious thing about natural patterns is that they come from a relatively limited palette,recurring at very different size scales and in systems that might seem to have nothing at all in common with one another. We see spirals, say, and hexagons, intricate branching forms of cracks and lightning, spots and stripes. It seems that there are types of pattern-forming process that don’t depend on the detailed specifics of a system but can crop up across the board, even bridging effortlessly the living and the non-living worlds.

它们的外观中存在着线索。也许自然图案（模式）最神奇的是它们来自一个相对有限的调色盘，它们以不同大小的尺度出现，并且在系统中似乎彼此毫无共同之处。我们能观察到螺旋形、六边形、复杂分支形态的裂缝和闪电、斑点和条纹。似乎有些类型的图案（模式）形成过程并不依赖于系统的具体细节，而是可以突然出现在整个系统中【涌现】，甚至毫不费力地将生命世界（有机体）与非生命世界（无机体）连接起来。

In this sense, pattern formation is universal: it doesn’t respect any of the normal boundaries that we tend to draw between different sciences or different types of phenomena.
在这个意义上，模式的形成是普遍的：它不遵从于我们所倾向的在不同科学或不同类型的现象之间绘制的任何正常边界。【这也正是它的奇妙之处，也是除了模式所能呈现的惊人的美感之外更可以让人深入探究的源头所在。】

■Growth and form?
Do these patterns have anything in common, or is the similarity in their appearance just coincidence? The first person to truly grapple with that question was the Scottish zoologist  D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson. In 1917 Thompson published his masterpiece, On Growth and Form, which collected together all that was then known about pattern and form in nature in a stunning synthesis of biology, natural history,mathematics, physics, and engineering. As the title indicates, Thompson pointed out that, in biology at least, and often in the non-living world, pattern formation is not a static thing but arises from growth. “Everything is what it is,” he said, “because it got that way.” The answer to the riddle of pattern lies in how it got to be that way—how the pattern grew. That’s less obvious than it sounds: a bridge or a paddy field or a microchip is “explained” by how it looks, not by how it was made.

生长和形态？  
这些模式有什么共同点，或者它们外表上的相似性只是巧合吗？  
第一个真正解决这个问题的人是苏格兰动物学家 D' Arcy Wentworth Thompson。1917  Thompson出版了他的《生长和形态（On Growth and Form）》的杰作，收集了所有在自然界中已知的有关模式和形态的惊人的综合体，综合体涉及生物学、自然史、数学、物理和工程学。正如标题所指出的， Thompson指出，至少在生物学上，并且在非生物的物质世界中，模式的形成不是静态的，而是由生长产生的。“一切都是这样的”他说，“因为它是生长得来的。”模式谜语的答案在于它是如何成长的。这听起来并不那么明显：一座桥、一片稻田或一颗微芯片会被“解释”为什么是看起来的样子，而不是它是如何被制造的。
