Nature’s Patterns-Flow

Nature’s Patterns A Tapestry in Three Parts
Philip Ball
Nature’s Patterns is a trilogy composed of Shapes, Flow, and Branches
First published 2009

Flow
MOVEMENT itself into eddies, and sometimes places these in strict array, where they become baroque and orderly conduits for creates pattern and form. Moving water arranges unceasing flow. The motions of air and water organize the skies, the earth, and the oceans. The hidden logic of gases in turmoil paints great spinning eyes on the outer planets. Out of the collisions of particles in motion, desert dunes arise and hills become striped with sorted grains.
Give these grains the ability to respond to their neighbours—make them fish, or birds, or buffalos—and there seems no end to the patterns that may appear, each an extraordinary collaboration that no individual has ordained or planned.
运动本身进入漩涡，有时把它们放在严格的阵列中，在那里它们变成巴洛克和有序的管道来创造模式和形式。流动的水安排不断的流动。空气和水的运动组织天空、地球和海洋。混乱中的气体隐藏的逻辑描绘了外部行星上巨大的旋转眼睛。在运动中的粒子碰撞中，沙漠沙丘出现，而丘陵变成有分选颗粒的条纹。
给予这些谷物对它们的邻居做出反应的能力，使它们成为鱼、鸟或水牛，并且似乎没有结束的模式，每一个都是一个非凡的合作，没有任何个体被指定或计划。

Preface and acknowledgements
A FTER in Nature readers asking where they could get hold of a copy. That was my 1999 book went out of print, I’d often be contacted by would-be The Self-Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation how I discovered that copies were changing hands in the used-book market for considerably more than the original cover price. While that was gratifying in its way, I would far rather see the material accessible to anyone who wanted it. So I approached Latha Menon at Oxford University Press to ask about a reprinting. But Latha had something more substantial in mind, and that is how this new trilogy came into being.
Quite rightly, Latha perceived that the original Tapestry was neither conceived nor packaged to the best advantage of the material. I hope this format does it more justice.

序言与致谢
一个天生的读者问他们在哪里可以拿到一份拷贝。这是我的1999本书绝版了，我经常会被自己制作的挂毯联系起来：模式的形成，我发现复制品在二手书市场上比原来的封面价格要大得多。虽然这是令人满意的方式，我宁愿看到任何人都可以访问的材料。所以我在牛津大学出版社采访了Latha Menon，想问一下重印。但是Latha有一个更重要的东西，那就是这个新三部曲是如何形成的。
很恰当地，Latha发现原来的挂毯既没有构思，也没有包装成材料的最佳优点。我希望这种格式更公正。

The suggestion of partitioning the material between three volumes sounded challenging at first, but once I saw how it might be done, I realized that this offered a structure that could bring more thematic organization to the topic. Each volume is self-contained and does not depend on one having read the others, although there is inevitably some cross-referencing. Anyone who has seen The Self-Made Tapestry will find some familiar things here, but also plenty that is new. In adding that material, I have benefited from the great generosity of many scientists who have given images, reprints and suggestions.
I am particularly grateful to Sean Carroll, Iain Couzin, and Andrea Rinaldo for critical readings of some of the new text. Latha set me more work than I’d perhaps anticipated, but I remain deeply indebted to her for her vision of what these books might become, and her encouragement in making that happen.
在三卷之间划分材料的建议起初听起来很有挑战性，但是一旦我看到它是如何完成的，我意识到这提供了一个可以给主题带来更多的主题组织的结构。每一卷都是自包含的，不依赖于阅读别人的书，尽管不可避免地会有一些交叉引用。任何看过自己制作的挂毯的人都会在这里找到一些熟悉的东西，但也有很多新的东西。在添加这些材料时，我受益于许多科学家的慷慨，他们给予了图像、重印和建议。
我特别感谢Sean Carroll、Iain Couzin和Andrea Rinaldo对一些新文本的批判性阅读。Latha给我的工作比我预想的要多，但我对她对这些书可能成为什么的憧憬深感感激，并鼓励她做到这一点。

The Man Who Loved Fluids Leonardo’s Legacy

PERHAPS personify polyvalent virtuosity, defining the concept of the Renaissance man and becoming a symbol for the unity of all it is not so strange after all that the man who has come to learning and creative endeavour, was something of an under-achiever.
That might seem an odd label to attach to Leonardo da Vinci, but the fact is that he started very little and finished even less. His life was a succession of plans made and never realized, of commissions refused (or accepted and never honoured), of studies undertaken with such a mixture of obsessive diligence and lack of system or objective that they could offer little instruction to future generations. This was not because Leonardo was a laggard; on the contrary, his ambitions often exceeded his capacity to fulfil them.

热爱流体的人列奥纳多的遗产
也许是人格多才多艺，定义文艺复兴时期的人的概念，并成为所有人的统一的象征，这并不奇怪，毕竟，来学习和创造性努力的人，是一个不速之客。
这似乎是一个奇怪的标签附加到达·芬奇，但事实是，他开始很少，完成甚至更少。他的一生是一连串的计划，从来没有意识到，被拒绝（或接受和不尊重）的委员会的研究，都是以强迫性的勤奋和缺乏系统或目标的混合来进行的，以至于他们对未来的后代几乎没有什么指导作用。这并不是因为列奥纳多是一个落后者，相反，他的野心往往超过了他实现这些目标的能力。

Yet if Leonardo did not achieve as much as we feel he might have done, that did not prevent his contemporaries from recognizing his extraordinary genius. The Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari was prone to eulogize all his subjects in his sixteenth-century Lives of the Artists, but he seems to make a special effort for Leonardo:
In the normal course of events many men and women are born with various remarkable qualities and talents; but occasionally, in a way that transcends nature, a single person is marvellously endowed by heaven with beauty, grace, and talent in such abundance that he leaves other men far behind, all his actions seem inspired, and indeed everything he does clearly comes from God rather than from human art. Everyone acknowledged that this was true of Leonardo da Vinci, an artist of outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything he did and who cultivated his genius so brilliantly that all problems he studied he solved with ease.

然而，如果列奥纳多没有达到我们认为他可能做的那么多，那并不能阻止他的同时代人认识到他非凡的天才。意大利艺术家和作家瓦萨里在他十六世纪的艺术家生涯中很容易赞美所有的主题，但他似乎对列奥纳多做出了特别的努力：
在正常的情况下，许多男人和女人天生就具有非凡的品质和才能；但偶尔，在超越自然的方式中，一个人被上天赋予了美丽、优雅和才华，他把其他人远远地抛在后面。他的行为似乎受到启发，他所做的一切显然都来自上帝，而不是来自人类艺术。每个人都承认，达·芬奇是一位杰出的身体美艺术家，他在他所做的每一件事中都表现出无限的优雅，他把自己的才华培养得如此出色，以至于他所研究的所有问题都很容易地解决了。


What Vasari did not wish to admit is that such an embarrassment of riches can be a burden rather than a blessing, and that it sometimes takes duller men to see a project through to its end while geniuses can only initiate them without cease. Leonardo’s devotion to the study of nature and science could leave his artistic patrons frustrated. Isabella d’Este, marchesa of Mantua, was told by an emissary whom she dispatched to Florence to commission a portrait from the great painter, that ‘he is working hard at geometry and is very impatient of painting . . . In short his mathematical experiments have so estranged him from painting that he cannot bear to take up a brush.’

Vasari不想承认的是，这样一种财富的尴尬可能是一种负担，而不是一种祝福，有时需要一个迟钝的人来看清一个项目的结束，而天才只能不断地发起。列奥纳多对自然和科学研究的献身精神使他的艺术赞助者感到沮丧。伊莎贝拉D'Eeste，曼托瓦的马切萨，被一名使者告诉她，她派遣到佛罗伦萨，委托一位伟大的画家的肖像，他正在努力工作几何，非常不耐烦的绘画。…简而言之，他的数学实验使他疏远了绘画，以至于他不能忍受拿起画笔。

But Leonardo was apt when the mood was upon him to labour without stint. His contemporary Matteo Bandello, a Piedmontese novelist, saw him at work on his ill-fated Last Supper: ‘It was his habit often,and I have frequently seen him, to go early in the morning and mount upon the scaffolding . . . it was his habit, I say, from sunrise until dusk never to lay down his brush, but, forgetful alike of eating and drinking,to paint without intermission.’ And yet his genius demanded space for reflection that he could ill afford. ‘At other times’, Bandello avers, ‘two,three or four days would pass without his touching the fresco, but he would remain before it for an hour or two at a time merely looking at it, considering, examining the figures.’ ‘Oh dear, this man will never do anything!’, Pope Leo X is said to have complained.

但当列奥纳多心情舒畅地劳动时，他却心平气和。他的当代皮埃蒙特小说家马代奥·班戴洛在他的最后一顿晚餐上看到他在工作：“这是他的习惯，我经常见到他，早早地走到脚手架上。”…这是他的习惯，我说，从日出到黄昏之前，他从来不放下刷子，但是，健忘一样的吃喝，绘画没有间歇。“然而，他的天才要求反思的空间，他负担不起。“在其他时候，”Bandello先生说，“两天，三天或四天，如果他不去碰壁画，他会在它面前呆上一两个小时，只是看着它，考虑检查这些数字。”“天哪，这个人什么都不会做！”据说，Pope Leo X抱怨过。

As his sketchbooks attest, lengthy and contemplative examination was his forte. When Leonardo looked at something, he saw more than other people. This was no idle gaze but an attempt to discern the very soul of things, the deep and elusive forms of nature. In his studies of anatomy, of animals and drapery, of plants and  andscapes, and of ripples and torrents of water, he shows us things that transcend the naturalistic: shapes that we might not directly perceive ourselves but that we suspect we would if we had Leonardo’s eyes.

正如他的速写书所证明的那样，冗长而深思熟虑的考试是他的强项。当列奥纳多看东西时，他看到的比其他人多。这不是一种懒散的凝视，而是一种尝试去辨别事物的灵魂，那是自然的深邃和难以捉摸的形式。在他的解剖学研究中，动物和帷幔，植物和景物，水的涟漪和洪流，他给我们展示了超越自然主义的东西：形状，我们可能无法直接感知我们自己，但是我们怀疑如果我们有列奥纳多的眼睛，我们会。

We are accustomed to list Leonardo’s talents as though trying to assign him to a university department: painter, sculptor, musician, anatomist, military and civil engineer, inventor, physicist. But his notebooks mock such distinctions. Rather, it seems that Leonardo was assailed by questions everywhere he looked, which he had hardly the opportunity or inclination to arrange into a systematic course of study. Is the sound of a blacksmith’s labours made with in the hammer or the anvil? Which will fire farthest, gunpowder doubled in quantity or in quality? What is the shape of corn tossed in a sieve? Are the tides caused by the  Moon or the Sun, or by the ‘breathing of the Earth’? From where do tears come, the heart or the brain? Why does a mirror exchange right and left? Leonardo scribbles these memos to himself in his cryptic lefthanded script; sometimes he finds  nswers, but often the question is left hanging. On his ‘to do’ list are items that boggle the mind with their casual boldness: ‘Make glasses in order to see the moon large.’ It is no wonder that Leonardo had no students and founded no school, for his was an intensely personal enquiry into nature, one intended to satisfy no one’s curiosity but his own.

我们习惯于把列奥纳多的天赋列为试图把他分配给大学系：画家、雕塑家、音乐家、解剖学家、军事和土木工程师、发明家、物理学家。但他的笔记本模仿这种区别。更确切地说，列奥纳多似乎被他所看到的问题所困扰，他几乎没有机会或倾向于安排一个系统的学习过程。铁匠的劳动是用锤子或铁砧制成的吗？火药会烧得最远，火药数量还是质量翻倍？玉米筛是什么形状的？潮汐是由月亮或太阳引起的，还是由“地球的呼吸”引起的？眼泪从哪里来，是心还是脑？为什么镜子会左右交换？列奥纳多把这些备忘录写在他神秘的左撇子脚本中；有时他发现NSWER，但通常问题悬而未决。在他的“待办事项”清单上，有一些让人心不在焉的东西：“为了看月亮而制作眼镜。”难怪列奥纳多没有学生，也没有学校，因为他是一个对大自然的强烈询问，目的是为了满足任何人的好奇心。但他自己的。

We come no closer to understanding this quest, however, if we persist in seeing Leonardo as an artist on the one hand and a scientist and technologist on the other. The common response is to suggest that he recognized no divisions between the two, and he is regularly invoked to advertise the notion that both are complementary means of studying and engaging with nature. This doesn’t quite hit the mark, however,because it tacitly accepts that ‘art’ and ‘science’ had the same connotations in Leonardo’s day as they do now. What Leonardo considered arte was the business of making things. Paintings were made by arte,but so were the apothecaries’ drugs and the weavers’ cloth. Until the Renaissance there was nothing particularly admirable about art, or at least about artists—patrons admired fine pictures, but the people who made them were tradesmen paid to do a job, and manual workers at that. Leonardo himself strove to raise the status of painting so that it might rank among the ‘intellectual’ or liberal arts, such as geometry,music, and astronomy. Although a formidable sculptor himself, he argued his case by dismissing it as ‘less intellectual’: it is more enduring, admittedly, ‘but excels in nothing else’. The academic and geometric character of treatises on painting at that time, most notably that of
the polymath Leon Battista Alberti, which can make painting seem less a matter of inspiration than a process of drawing lines and plotting light rays, derives partly from this agenda.

然而，如果我们坚持认为列奥纳多是艺术家，而另一方面是科学家和技术专家，我们就不会更接近理解这一追求。共同的反应是，他认为这两个之间没有分歧，他经常被援引广告的概念，这两者是互补的学习和参与自然的手段。然而，这并不是很好，因为它默认地接受“艺术”和“科学”在列奥纳多时代和现在一样具有相同的内涵。列奥纳多认为艺术品是做生意的。绘画是由阿尔特制作的，药剂师的药物和织布者也是如此。直到文艺复兴时期，没有什么特别令人钦佩的艺术，或者至少关于艺术家赞助人欣赏精美的图片，但那些人谁是做工作的商人，和手工工人在那。列奥纳多本人努力提高绘画的地位，使其可以跻身于“智力”或“文科”，如几何学、音乐和天文学。尽管他本人是一位令人敬畏的雕塑家，但他把自己的论点驳斥为“不那么聪明”：无可否认，它更具持久性，但在其他方面却毫无用处。当时关于绘画的学术和几何特征，最著名的是列昂，巴蒂斯塔阿尔贝蒂，它可以使绘画看起来不像灵感的过程，而不是绘制线条和绘制光线的过程，部分源于这个议程。

Scienza, in contrast, was knowledge—but not necessarily that obtained by careful experiment and enquiry. Medieval scholastics had insisted that knowledge was what appeared in the books of Euclid, Aristotle,Ptolemy, and other ancient writers, and that the learned man was one who had memorized these texts. The celebrated humanism of the Renaissance did not challenge this idea but merely refreshed it, insisting on returning to the original sources rather than relying on Arabic and medieval glosses. In this regard, Leonardo was not a ‘scientist’, since he was not well schooled—the humble son of a minor notary and a peasant woman, he was defensive all his life about his poor Latin and ignorance of Greek. He believed in the importance of scienza, certainly,but for him this did not consist solely of book-learning. It was an active pursuit, and demanded experiments, though Leonardo did not exactly conduct them in the manner that a modern scientist would. For him,true insight came from peering beneath the surface of things. That is why his painstaking studies of nature, while appearing superficially Aristotelian in their attention to particulars, actually have much more of a Platonic spirit: they are an attempt to see what is really there, not what appears to be. This is why he had to sit and stare for hours: not to see things more sharply, but, as it were, to stop seeing, to transcend the limitations of his eyes.

相比之下，SiZiNa是知识，但不一定是通过仔细的实验和探究获得的。中世纪的经院学家坚持认为，知识是Euclid、亚里士多德、托勒密和其他古代作家的著作中出现的，而学识的人就是记住这些文本的人。文艺复兴时期著名的人文主义并没有挑战这一想法，而是仅仅刷新了它，坚持回到原来的源头，而不是依靠阿拉伯和中世纪的光泽。在这方面，列奥纳多不是一个“科学家”，因为他没有受过良好教育，一个小公证人和一个农妇的卑微儿子，他一生都在捍卫他可怜的拉丁语和对希腊的无知。他相信科学研究所的重要性，但对他来说，这不仅仅是书本学习。这是一种积极的追求，需要实验，尽管列奥纳多并没有像现代科学家那样精确地进行实验。对他来说，真正的洞察力来自于事物表面下的凝视。这就是为什么他对大自然的刻苦研究，虽然表面上看Aristotelian在关注细节方面，其实更多的是一种柏拉图式的精神：他们试图看到真正存在的东西，而不是看起来是什么。这就是为什么他不得不坐着盯着看几个小时：不要看得更清楚，而是要停止观察，超越他的眼睛的局限。

Leonardo regarded the task of the painter to be not naturalistic mimicry, which shows only the surface contours and shallow glimmers of the world, but the use of reason to shape his vision and distil from it a kind of universal truth. ‘At this point’, Leonardo wrote of those who would grow tired of his theoretical musings on the artist’s task, ‘the opponent says that he does not want so much scienza, that practice is enough for him in order to draw the things in nature. The answer to this is that there is nothing that deceives us more easily than our confidence in our judgement, divorced from reasoning.’ This could have been written by Plato himself, famously distrustful of the deceptions of painters.

列奥纳多认为画家的任务不是自然而然的拟态，它只展示了世界的表面轮廓和浅浅的光芒，而是运用理性来塑造他的视觉，并从中提炼出一种普遍真理。在这一点上，列奥纳多写到那些对艺术家的任务厌倦了他理论上的沉思的人，“对手说他不需要那么多的科学研究，对于他来说，实践是足够的，以便在自然界中画出事物。这个问题的答案是，没有什么比我们对判断的信心更容易被欺骗，脱离了推理。“这可能是由Plato自己写的，著名的不信任画家的欺骗。

I hope you can start to appreciate why I have placed Leonardo centre stage in introducing this volume of my survey of nature’s patterns. As I explained in Book I, the desire to look through nature and find its underlying forms and structures is what characterizes the approach of some of the pioneers in the study of pattern formation, such as the German biologist Ernst Haeckel and the Scottish zoologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson. Haeckel was another gifted artist who firmly believed that the natural world needs to be arranged, ordered, tidied, before its forms and generative impulses can be properly perceived. Thompson shared Leonardo’s conviction that the similarities of form and pattern we see in very different situations—for Leonardo it might be the cascades ofa water spout and a woman’s hair—reveal a deep-seated relationship.

我希望你能开始理解为什么我把列奥纳多中心舞台引入了我对自然模式的调查。正如我在第一本书中所解释的那样，对自然界的探索和发现其潜在的形式和结构的愿望，是研究模式形成的一些先驱的方法的特征，如德国生物学家艾伦斯特和苏格兰动物学家D'ARCY文特沃斯汤普森。海克尔是另一位有天赋的艺术家，他坚信自然世界需要被安排、整理、整理，在其形式和生成冲动能够被正确感知之前。汤普森分享列奥纳多的信念，即我们在不同的情况下看到的形式和模式的相似性对列奥纳多来说可能是瀑布的瀑布和女人的头发揭示了深层次的关系。

D’Arcy Thompson’s view of such correspondences is one we can still accept in science today, based as it is on the idea that the same forces are likely to be at play in both cases. Leonardo’s rationalization is more remote now from our experience, being rooted in the tradition of Neoplatonism that saw these correspondences as a central feature of nature’s divine architecture: as above, so below, as the reductive formulation has it. When Leonardo calls rivers the blood of the Earth, and comments on how their channels resemble the veins of the human
body, he is not engaging in some vague metaphor or visual pun; the two are related because the Earth is indeed a kind of living body and can therefore be expected to echo the structures of our own anatomy.

汤普森对这种对应的看法是我们今天在科学上仍然可以接受的观点，因为它是基于同样的力量在两种情况下都可能发挥作用的观点。列奥纳多的理性化现在离我们的经验更为遥远，它植根于新柏拉图主义的传统中，认为这些契合是大自然神圣建筑的中心特征：如上，下面是还原式的。当列奥纳多把河流称为地球的血液，并评论它们的通道如何与人体的血管相似时，他不参与一些模糊的比喻或视觉双关；这两个是相关的，因为地球确实是一种活体，因此可以期待结构的回声。我们自己的解剖结构。

In this vision of a kind of hidden essence of nature, we can find the true nexus of Leonardo’s ‘art’ and ‘science’. We tend to think of his art as ‘lifelike’, and Vasari made the same mistake. He praises the vase of flowers that appears in one of Leonardo’s Madonnas for its ‘wonderful realism’, but then goes on, I think inadvertently, to make a telling remark by saying that the flowers ‘had on them dewdrops that looked more convincing than the real thing’. Leonardo might have answered that this was because he had indeed painted ‘the real thing’ and not what his eyes had shown him. His work is not photographic but stylized, synthetic, even abstract, and he admits openly that painting is a work not of imitation but of invention: ‘a subtle inventione which with philosophy and subtle speculation considers the natures of all forms’.

在这一自然的隐秘本质中，我们可以找到列奥纳多的“艺术”与“科学”的真正联系。我们倾向于认为他的艺术是“栩栩如生”，而Vasari也犯了同样的错误。他称赞列奥纳多的圣母玛瑙中出现的花瓶，因为它是“美妙的现实主义”，但后来我不经意地说：“花上的露珠比真实的东西更有说服力。”列奥纳多可能会回答说，这是因为他确实画了“真实的东西”，而不是他的眼睛给他看的东西。他的作品不是摄影的，而是程式化的、合成的、抽象的，他公开承认绘画不是模仿而是发明的作品：“一种微妙的发明，它用哲学和微妙的推测来思考所有形式的本质。”

Leonardo ‘is thinking of art not simply in technical terms’, says art historian Adrian Parr, ‘where the artist skillfully renders a form on the canvas...Rather, he takes the relationship of nature to art onto a deeper level, intending to express in his art ‘‘every kind of form produced in nature’’.’ For indeed, as the art  historian Martin Kemp explains, ‘Leonardo saw nature as weaving an infinite variety of elusive patterns on the basic warp and woof of mathematical perfection.’ And so, without a doubt, did D’Arcy Thompson.

艺术史历史学家Adrian Parr说：“列奥纳多对艺术的思考不是简单的技术术语”，艺术家在画布上巧妙地表现出一种形式……他把自然与艺术的关系带到更深的层次上，意欲在他的艺术中表现出“每种形式”。事实上，正如艺术历史学家马亭坎普所解释的，“列奥纳多看到自然界是在数学完美的基本扭曲和编织上编织了无数种难以捉摸的图案。”毫无疑问，汤普森是这样做的。

Leonardian flows
While most painters used technique to create a simulacrum of nature,Leonardo felt that one could not imbue the picture with life until one understood how nature does it. His sketches, then, are not exactly studies but something between an experiment and a diagram—attempts to intuit the forces at play (Fig. 1.1). ‘Leonardo’s use of swirling,curving, revolving and wavy patterns, becomes a means of both investigating and entering into the rhythmic movements of nature’, says Parr.

Leonardian流
虽然大多数画家使用技术来创造一个自然的仿真器，但列奥纳多认为，一个人不能用生命来灌输这幅图画，直到人们了解大自然是如何做到的。他的草图，并不是精确的研究，而是在实验和图表之间试图尝试在游戏中发挥力量（图1.1）。Parr说，列奥纳多使用漩涡、弯曲、旋转和波浪状的图案，成为研究和进入自然节奏运动的一种手段。


Fig. 1.1: A sketch of flowing water by Leonardo da Vinci.

Other western artists have tried to capture the forms of movement and flow, whether in the boiling vapours painted by J. M. W. Turner, the stopframe dynamism of Marcel Duchamp’s Nude Descending a Staircase (1912) or the fragmented frenzy of the Italian Futurists. But these are impressionistic, ad hoc and subjective efforts that lack Leonardo’s scientific sense of pattern and order. Perhaps it is impossible truly to depict the world in this way unless you are a Neoplatonist. When John Constable declared in the early nineteenth century that ‘Painting is a science and should be pursued as an inquiry into the laws of nature’, he had in mind something far more mechanistic: that the painter should understand how physics and meteorology create a play of light and shadow, so that the paintings become convincing in an illusionistic sense.

其他西方艺术家试图捕捉运动和流动的形式，无论是在由J.M.W.特纳绘制的沸腾蒸汽，马塞尔·杜尚的裸体框架的动态下降楼梯（1912）或意大利未来主义者的分裂狂热。但这些都是印象主义、特设和主观的努力，缺乏列奥纳多的科学模式和秩序感。也许除非你是新柏拉图主义者，否则不可能用这种方式描绘世界。当约翰·康斯太勃尔在十九世纪初宣布“绘画是一门科学，应该作为对自然规律的探索”时，他想到了一个更具机械性的东西：画家应该理解物理学和气象学是如何创造一个光与影的游戏的。从而使绘画在幻觉意义上变得有说服力。

But while a Leonardian perspective is valuable for surveying all nature’s patterns, I have made him the pinion for this volume on patterns of motion, in fluids particularly, because there were few topics that enthralled him (and I mean that in its original sense) more than this. Of all the passions that he evinced, none seems more ardent than the wish to understand water. One senses that he regards it as the central elemental force: ‘water is the driver of Nature’, he says, ‘It is never at rest until it unites with the sea . . . It is the expansion and humour of all vital bodies.

但是，尽管Leonardian的视角对于测量自然界的所有模式都是有价值的，但我已经让他成为了这个体积的运动模式的小齿轮，特别是在流体中，因为没有什么主题能吸引他（我的意思是，在其最初意义上）。在他所表达的所有激情中，没有一种比渴望了解水更热切。他认为它是中心元素的力量：“水是大自然的驱动者”，他说：“它永远不会静止，直到它与大海结成一体。”…它是所有生命体的扩张和幽默。

Without it nothing retains its form. It is no wonder, then, that one of Leonardo’s most revealing and famous notebooks, known as the Codex Leicester or Codex Hammer,* is mostly concerned with water. There was hardly an aspect of water that Leonardo did not leave unexamined. He wrote about sedimentation and erosion in rivers, and how they produce meanders and sand ripples on the river bed (two patterns I consider later). He discussed how water circulates on the Earth in what we now call the hydrological cycle, evaporating from the seas and falling as rain on to high ground. He asked why the sea is salty and wondered why a man can remain underwater only ‘for such a time as he can hold his breath’. He investigated Archimedes spirals for lifting water, as well as suction pumps and water wheels. He drew astonishing ‘aerial’ pictures of river networks (we’ll see them in Book III), and planned great works of hydraulic engineering. In collaboration with Niccolo 'Machiavelli, he drew up a scheme to redirect the flow of the Arno River away from Pisa, thereby depriving the city of its water supply and delivering it into the hands of the Florentines.

没有它，就没有它的形式。“难怪，列奥纳多最著名和最著名的笔记本，即莱斯特法典或法典，最主要的是水。几乎没有一个方面的水，列奥纳多没有离开未经审查。他写了关于河流中的沉积和侵蚀，以及它们如何在河床上产生蜿蜒和沙纹（我后来考虑的两种模式）。他讨论了水在地球上循环的过程，我们现在称之为水文循环，从海洋蒸发，降雨到高地。他问为什么海水是咸的，想知道为什么一个人只有在他能屏住呼吸的时候才能保持在水下。他研究了阿基米德螺旋提升水，以及抽吸泵和水轮。他绘制了令人惊叹的“河网”图片（我们将在第三本书中看到），并计划了水利工程的伟大著作。与Niccolo马基雅维利合作，他拟定了一个方案，将阿诺河的流向重新从比萨撤出，从而剥夺了该市的供水，并将其输送到Florentines手中。

It seems that Leonardo did not become fascinated by water because of his engineering activities; rather, according to art historian Arthur Popham, the latter were a symptom of the former: ‘Something in the movement of water, its swirls and eddies, corresponded to some deepseated twist in his nature.’ No aspect of water captured his interest more than the eddies of a flowing stream. He wrote long lists of the features of these vortices that he intended at some point to investigate:
Of eddies wide at the mouth and narrow at the base.
Of eddies very wide at the base and narrow above.
Of eddies of the shape of a column.
Of eddies formed between two masses of water that rub together.
And so on—pages and pages of optimistic plans, of experiments halfstarted, of speculations and ideas, all described in such obsessive detail that even Leonardo scholars have pronounced them virtually unreadable. ‘He wants’, says the art historian Ernst Gombrich, ‘to classify vortices as a zoologist classifies the species of animals.’

列奥纳多似乎并没有因为他的工程活动而被水迷住，而是根据艺术历史学家Arthur Popham所说的，后者是前者的一个征兆：“水的运动，漩涡和漩涡中的东西，对应着他的自然中的一些深层扭曲。没有一个水面比流淌的溪流更能吸引他的兴趣。他写了一些关于这些旋涡特征的长列表，他打算在某个时候进行研究：
漩涡在嘴边宽而在底部狭窄。
漩涡在基部非常宽且在上面狭窄。
圆柱形状的漩涡。
漩涡形成在两块相互摩擦的水之间。
页面和页面上的乐观计划、实验半衰期、猜测和想法等，都被描述得如此痴迷，甚至连列奥纳多学者都宣称它们实际上是不可读的。艺术历史学家Ernst Gombrich说，他想要把旋涡分类为动物学家把动物的种类分类。

To judge from his sketches, Leonardo conducted a thorough, if haphazard, experimental programme on the flow patterns of water, watching it pass down channels of different shapes, charting the chaos of plunging waterfalls, and placing obstacles in the flow to see how they generated new forms. His drawings of water surging around the sides of a plate face-on to the flow show a delicately braided wake (Fig. 1.2a), and the resemblance to the braided hair of a woman in a preparatory study (Fig. 1.2b) is no coincidence, for as Leonardo said himself, Observe the motion of the surface of the water which resembles that of hair, which has two motions, of which one depends on the weight of the hair, the other on the direction of the curls; thus the water forms eddying whirlpools, one point of which is due to the impetus of the original current and the other to the incidental motion and return flow.

of the braids in a woman’s hair (b).


Fig. 1.3: Leonardo sketched shock waves caused by constrictions in a channel (a) and the shape of wakes in flow around an obstacle (b).

His self-portrait from 1512 shows his long hair and beard awash with eddies.
Many of these visual records are remarkably fine: he illustrates shock waves and ripples caused by constriction and widening of a channel (Fig. 1.3a), and his drawings of the flow past a cylindrical obstruction display the teardrop wake and the paired vortices (Fig. 1.3b) that have been found in modern experiments (see page 28). Fluid scientists today typically use techniques for revealing flow-forms that Leonardo is often said to have invented: fine particles that reflect light are suspended in the water, or coloured dyes are added to part of the flow. ‘If you throw sawdust down into a running stream’, Leonardo said,you will be able to observe where the water turned upside down after striking against the banks throws this sawdust back towards the centre of the stream, and also the revolutions of the water and where other water either joins it or separates from it; and many other things.
Roughly speaking, these floating particles map out what are now called streamlines, which can be thought of as the trajectories of the flow.* In this sense, Leonardo’s studies of flow patterns were thoroughly modern.

A streamline has a technical definition: it is a line within the fluid for which the tangent at any point shows the direction of flow at that point. Streamlines show not only ‘where the fluid is going’ but also how fast: where streamlines are close together, the velocity is high. In steady flows, where the pattern of flow doesn’t change over time, the path of a suspended particle or the trajectory of dye injected at a point, the particle path or so-called streakline of the dye trace out streamlines. But if the flow is unsteady, this is no longer true; the particle paths or streaklines can give an impression of the streamlines, and the true streamlines can
be deduced from them, but they are not the same thing.

But he had only his eyes and his memory to guide him in translating from what he saw to what he drew; and as art historians know, that translation occurs in a context of preconceived notions of style and motif that condition what is depicted. When Leonardo compares a flow to hair, he is struck initially by the resemblance, but then this correspondence superimposes what he knows of the way hair falls on what he sees in the stream of water. The result is, as Popham says, that although [t]he cinematographic vision which could see, the prodigious memory which could retain and the hand which could record these evanescent and intangible formations are little short of miraculous. .. [t]hese drawings do not so much convey the impression of water as of some exquisite submarine vegetable growth.

Was Leonardo able to do anything beyond recording what he perceived? Did he elucidate the reasons why these marvellous patterns are formed in water? If we have to admit that he did not really do that, it is no disgrace, since that problem is one of the hardest of all in physical science, and has still not been completely solved. On the whole the flows that Leonardo was studying were turbulent, fast-moving and unsteady in the extreme, so that they changed from one moment to the next. If he could describe these flows only in pictures and words,scientists could do no better than that until the twentieth century. And what vivid descriptions he gave!—The whole mass of water, in its breadth, depth and height, is full of innumerable varieties of movements, as is shown on the surface of currents with a moderate degree of turbulence, in which one sees continually gurglings and eddies with
various swirls formed by the more turbid water from the bottom as it rises to the surface.
Leonardo made some discoveries that stand up today. His comment that ‘water in straight rivers is swifter the farther it is from the shore, its impediment’, for example, is an elegant description of what fluid scientists call the velocity profile of flow in a channel, which is determined by the way friction between the fluid and the channel wall brings the flow there virtually to a standstill. Leonardo’s explanation of how river meanders are caused by shifting patterns of sedimentation and erosion by the flow contain all the elements that today’s earth scientists recognize.
His legacy for our understanding of fluid flow patterns goes deeper than this, however. As far as we can tell, Leonardo was the first Western scientist to really make the case that this phenomenon deserves serious study. And chaos but contains persistent forms that can be recognized, recorded,analysed—forms, moreover, that are things of great beauty, of value to the artist as well as the scientist.

Transcendental forms
All the same, Leonardo’s idiosyncratic, hermetic way of working meant that no research programme stemmed from his achievements. No scientist seems subsequently to have thought very much about fluid flows until the Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli began to investigate them in the seventeenth century.*
Nor did Leonardo’s work on fluid motion have any artistic legacy: his studies of flows as a play of patterns, forms, and streamlines leave no trace in Western art. Artists looked instead for a stylized realism which
insisted that turbulent water be depicted as a play of glinting highlights and surging foam: a style that is all surface, you might say. Just about any dramatic seascape of the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries will show this—George Morland’s The Wreckers (1791) is a good example (Fig. 1.4).
A fluid style akin to Leonardo’s does not show up again in Western art until the lively arabesques of the Art Nouveau movement of the late nineteenth century (Fig. 1.5). These artists took their inspiration from natural forms, such as the elegant curves and spirals of plant stems. As I discussed in Book I, the delicate frond-like forms discovered at this time in marine organisms and drawn with great panache and skill by Ernst Haeckel became a significant influence on the German branch of this movement, known as the Jugendstil—a two-way interaction that
probably conditioned the way Haeckel drew in the first place. In England these trends produced something truly Leonardian in the works of the illustrator Arthur Rackham, where the correspondences between the waves and vortices of water, smoke, hair, and vegetation are particularly explicit (Fig. 1.6). But the use of vortical imagery here is really nothing more than a style, valued for its decorative and allusive qualities: there is no real sense that the artists are, like Leonardo,*Rene ´ Descartes made much of vortices, becoming convinced that the entire universe is filled with an ethereal fluid that swirls at all scales. Their gyrating motions, he said, carry
along the heavenly bodies, explaining the circulations of the planets and stars. His theory, however, does not seem to owe any inspiration to Leonardo’s work on eddies.

simultaneously conducting an investigation into nature’s forms rather than simply adapting them for aesthetic ends.
One of the sources of the bold lines and sinuous forms of Art Nouveau is, however, more pertinent. In the mid-nineteenth century trade opened up between Western Europe and the Far East, and Japanese woodblock prints came into vogue among artist and collectors. Here Western artists found a very different way of depicting the world—not as naturalistic chiaroscuro but as a collage of flat, clearly delineated elements that disdains the rules of scientific optics and makes no pretence of photographic trompe l’oeil. To the Western eye these pictures are stylized and schematic, but some artists could see that this was not mere affectation, less still a simplification. What was being conveyed was the essence of things, unobstructed by superficial incidentals.
It is as simplistic to generalize about Chinese and Japanese art as it is about the art of the West—these traditions, too, have their different periods and schools and philosophies. But it is fair to say that most
Chinese artists have attempted to imbue their works with Ch’i, the vital Fig. 1.4: The Wreckers by George Morland shows the typical manner in which Western painters depicted flow as a play of light. (Image: Copyright Southampton City Art Gallery, Hampshire, UK/The Bridgeman Art Library.)
Fig. 1.5: Alphonse Mucha’s Art Nouveau style emphasizes the arabesque patterns of flow.

energy of the universe, the Breath of the Tao. Ch’i is undefinable and cannot be understood intellectually; the seventeenth-century painter’s manual Chieh Tzu Yu ¨an (The Mustard Seed Garden) explains that ‘Circulation of the Ch’i produces movement of life.’ So while the Taoist conviction that there exists a fundamental simplicity beyond the superficial shapes and forms of the world sounds Platonic, in fact it differs Fig. 1.6: Arthur Rackham’s illustrations are Leonardian in their conflation of the eddies and tendrils of fluid flow and the swirling of hair. (Image: Bridgeman Art Library.)

fundamentally. Unlike Plato’s notion of static, crystalline ideal forms,the Tao is alive with spontaneity. It is precisely this spontaneity that the Chinese classical artist would try to capture with movements of the
brush: ‘He who uses his mind and moves his brush without being conscious of painting touches the secret of the art of painting’, said the writer Chang Yen-yu ¨an in the ninth century. In Chinese art everything depends on the brushstrokes, the source and signifier of Ch’i.
No wonder, then, that among the stroke types classified by artistic tradition was one called T’an wo ts’un: brushstrokes like an eddy or whirlpool. No wonder either that the ancient painters of China would say ‘Take five days to place water in a picture.’ What could be more representative of the Tao than the currents of a river swirling around rocks? But because the Tao is dynamic, an illusionistic rendering of a frozen instant, like that in Western art, would be meaningless. Instead, Chinese painters attempted to portray the inner life of flow, or what the  approximating the trajectories of floating particles, like the streamlines employed by fluid
dynamicists. This is not a ‘realistic’ but a schematic depiction of flow. These images are taken
from a painting instruction manual compiled in the late seventeenth century. (From M. M. Sze (ed.)

Fig. 1.7: In Chinese art, the flow of water is commonly represented as a series of lines

twelfth-century Chinese critic Tung Yu ¨ called ‘the fundamental nature
of water’. They schematized flow-forms as a series of lines (Fig. 1.7),
again remarkably like the scientist’s streamlines. Some of Leonardo’s
sketches are very similar; one could almost mistake some of his drawings for those of an East Asian artist (Fig. 1.8).
Ebb and flow
It is not quite true to say that Leonardo’s project to animate his drawings of flow by capturing its fundamental forms and patterns has no
parallels in Western art. Something like streamlines seem to resurface
in Bridget Riley’s early monochrome op-art paintings (Fig. 1.9), where
the observer’s eye is persuaded that there is real movement, real flow,
still proceeding on the canvas. It may be that the Spiral Jetty (1970) of
American earthwork artist Robert Smithson, a coil of rock and stone
projecting into the Great Salt Lake of Utah, is meant to invoke one of the
Leonardian vortices in the water that surrounds it. The American

sculptor Athena Tacha makes extensive use of a vocabulary of flow
forms that includes spirals, waves and eddies—her source of inspiration is made particularly explicit in a 1977 work Eddies/Interchanges
(Homage to Leonardo) (Fig. 1.10), which she proposed as a walkway or
even a ‘drive-in sculpture’.

Current (1964), show something akin to streamlines that convey a

THE MAN WHO LOVED FLUIDS j 19
But perhaps the modern works that most successfully recapitulate
Leonardo’s enquiry into the forms of nature are those of the British
photographer Susan Derges. She immersed huge sheets of photographic paper protected between glass plates just beneath the water
surface of the River Taw in Devon, south-west England, and illuminated
them at night with a very brief flash of light. All the little peaks and
troughs of surface waves are imprinted on the photographic image as a
kind of shadowgraph (Fig. 1.11). Overhanging vegetation is sometimes
imprinted too, evident only as a silhouette in the manner of a Japanese
print. Derges has herself studied Japanese art—she lived in Japan in the
1980s, where she was influenced by the works of Hiroshige and Hokusai—and she is familiar with the Taoist notion of distilling the universal
from the particular.
Like Leonardo’s drawings, these photographs could serve either as
works of art or as scientific records, since what emerges from a dialogue
with nature’s patterns can be viewed either way.

Patterns Downstream 2
Order That Flows
T HERE flow, frozen by the blink of a camera’s shutter, have artistic appeal. As early as the 1870s, the British physicist Arthur is nothing new in the idea that the transient forms of fluid
Worthington used high-speed photography to capture the hidden
beauty of splashes. He dropped pebbles into a trough of water and
discovered that the splash has an unguessed complexity and beauty
with a surprising degree of symmetry and order. Worthington worked
at the Royal Naval College in Devonport on the south-west coast of
England, where the study of impacts in water had decidedly unromantic
implications; but one senses that Worthington lost sight of the military
origins of his research as he fell under the allure of these images. A splash,
he found, erupts into a corona with a rim that breaks up into a series of
spikes, each of them releasing micro-droplets of their own (Fig. 2.1).
There is, he said, something seemingly ‘orderly and inevitable’ in these
forms, although he admitted that ‘it taxes the highest mathematical
powers’ to describe and explain them. In 1908 he collected his pictures
in a book called A Study of Splashes, which aimed to please the eye as
much as to inform the mind.
Worthington realized that the images were clearest if the liquid was
opaque, and so he used milk instead of water (the two are not equivalent, for the higher viscosity of milk alters the shape of the splash). His
sequences of photos appear to represent a series of successive snapshots taken during the course of a single splash. But that is a forgivable
deception, for Worthington didn’t have a camera shutter able to open
and close at such a rate. Instead, each splash yielded a single image,
revealed in a flash of light from a spark that lasted for just a few
millionths of a second in a darkened room. To capture the sequence,
Worthington simply timed the spark at successively later instants in the
course of many splashes that he hoped were more or less identical.
Worthington suspected that these pictures might appeal to the public’s sense of beauty, but he didn’t capitalize on them with anything like
the chutzpah of his successor, the American electrical engineer Harold
Edgerton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the 1920s
Edgerton realized that the newly invented stroboscope could ‘freeze’
rapid, repetitive motions when the flash rate of the lamp was

Worthington in the late nineteenth century.

synchronized with the cycling rate of the movement. He developed a
stroboscopic photographic system that could take 3,000 frames
per second. His high-speed photographs became famous thanks to
Edgerton’s sense of eye-catching subject and composition: he took
split-second pictures of famous sportspeople and actors, and his iconic

‘Shooting the Apple’ pays homage to the legend of William Tell while
revealing the compelling destructiveness of a speeding bullet. In Edgerton’s quickfire lens, water running from the tap becomes petrified into
what appears to be a mound of solid glass. His book Flash (1939) was
unashamedly populist, a coffee-table collection of remarkable shots,
and his film Quicker ‘n a Wink (1940) won an Oscar the following year
for the best short film.
But probably the most memorable of Edgerton’s images was copied
straight from Worthington: he filmed milk droplets as they splash into a
smooth liquid surface. Edgerton’s drop is tidier, somehow more regular
and orderly, a true marvel of natural pattern (Fig. 2.2a): each prong of
the crown is more or less equidistant from its neighbours, and each of
them disgorges a single spherical globule.* This is the secret structure
of rainfall, reproduced countless times as raindrops fall into ponds and
puddles. Edgerton’s milk splash has become an icon of hidden order, as
much a work of art as a scientific study. More prosaically, the image was
adopted in the 1990s in stylized form by the British milk-marketing and
distribution company Milk Marque (Fig. 2.2b). D’Arcy Thompson was
captivated by these structures, too. In his classic book On Growth and
Form (1917) he compared Worthington’s fluted cup with its ‘scolloped’
and ‘sinuous’ edges to the forms a potter makes at a more leisurely pace
from wet clay. Edgerton’s photograph provided the front plate for the
1944 revised edition of the book, where it was as though Thompson
were saying ‘Look here, this is my subject. Here is the full mystery—the
quotidian, ubiquitous mystery—of pattern.’
To Thompson, who possessed a finely honed instinct for similarities
of pattern and shape in nature, these splash-forms were not just a
curiosity of fluid flow but a manifestation of a more general patterning
process that could be seen also in the shapes of soft-tissued living
organisms. The bowl-like structure with its notched rim, he said, is
echoed in some species of hydroid, marine animals related to jellyfish
and sea anemones (Fig. 2.3). Of course, here the form is persistent,
not literally gone in a flash; yet ‘there is nothing’, Thompson said,
‘to prevent a slow and lasting manifestation, in a viscous medium
such as a protoplasmic organism, of phenomena which appear and
*You can watch Edgerton’s film of the splash online at <http://web.mit.edu/edgerton/

24 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
disappear with evanescent rapidity in a more mobile liquid.’ These
organisms, he argued ‘might conceivably display configurations analogous to, or identical with, those which Mr Worthington has shewn us
how to exhibit by one particular experimental method.’
As is often the case with On Growth and Form, the argument here is
largely a matter of wishful thinking. There is no good reason to think
that a hydroid grows as a splash grows—why, after all, should we then
expect it to become arrested in a particular ‘snapshot’, and not to erupt,
fragment and subside like the droplets that Worthington and Edgerton
produced?
All the same, there is a pattern here that demands explanation. What
is the reason for the undulating corona of a splash? Surprisingly, this is
still not clear. Whatever else, it is evidently a symmetry-breaking process, for the droplet initially has perfect circular symmetry when seen
from above; but in the corona this is disrupted as the spikes appear.
What is more, the process somehow introduces a characteristic distance or wavelength: the separation between adjacent spikes is more or
less constant around the rim. Below we will see other examples of this
‘wavelength selection’ in the patterns of fluid flow.
Whorls apart
The splash is an oddity, a curious little quirk of fluid behaviour. If one
were to judge from Leonardo’s studies, one might conclude that the
Fig. 2.3: D’Arcy Thompson noted similarities between Worthington’s
splashes, sketched on the left, and a type of hydroid, on the right.
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 25
leitmotif of fluid flow is a different structure, less symmetrical but still
exhibiting an unmistakable sense of organization: the whirlpool or
vortex (Fig. 2.4). When you think about it, the vortex is stranger and
more unexpected than the splash corona. The latter is a classic example
of a broken symmetry, a circle that develops a wobble; but the vortex
seems to come out of nowhere. Think of a river, flowing gracefully down
a barely perceptible gradient: why should the water start suddenly to
deviate sideways, where no gradient seems to drive it, and then—
curioser and curioser—to circulate back on itself, flowing (or so it
seems) uphill? Whence this apparently irrepressible tendency of a
liquid to swirl and coil?
What this question calls for is a science of fluid flow. That discipline is
variously called hydrodynamics (an indication of how water-centred
the topic is), fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics. I am going to explain
something about its theoretical foundation in this book’s final chapter;
but let me admit right now that this is not going to be particularly
revelatory. The theory of fluid dynamics is rather simple in conception,
unutterably difficult in most applications (unless you have help from a
powerful computer), and of limited value in providing any kind of
Fig. 2.4: Leonardo seemed to consider the vortex to be a fundamental feature of fluid flow.
26 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
intuitive picture of why fluids possess such an unnerving propensity for
pattern. It is, furthermore, a theory that is incomplete, for we still lack
any definitive understanding of the most extreme yet also the most
common state of fluid flow, which is turbulence. In everyday parlance,
‘turbulent’ is often a synonym for the disorganized, the chaotic, the
unpredictable—and while fluid turbulence does display these characteristics to a greater or lesser degree, we can see from Leonardo’s
sketches (which invariably show turbulent flows) that there is a kernel
of orderliness in this chaos, most especially in the sense that turbulent
flow often retains the organized motions that spawn vortices.
For now, I shall describe fluid flow in the manner in which scientists
since Leonardo have been mostly compelled to do: by observing and
drawing pictures and writing not equations but prose. The French
mathematician Jean Leray, one of the great pioneers of fluid dynamics
in the twentieth century, formulated his ideas while gazing for long
hours at the problem in hand, standing on the Pont Neuf in Paris and
watching the Seine surge and ripple under the bridge. It is a testament
to Leray’s genius that this experience did not simply overwhelm him,
for, as much as you may plot graphs and make meticulous lab notes,
observing the flow of fluids can easily leave you with a sense of grasping
at the intangible.
Thinking about the problem as Leray did can at least help us to see
where we should start. Here is the Seine—not, by all accounts, the most
sanitary of rivers in the early part of the last century—streaming around
the piles of the Pont Neuf. The water parts as it flows each side of the
pillars,andthisdisturbanceleavesitbillowingandturbulentdownstream.
To use the terminology we encountered in the first chapter, the streamlines become highly convoluted. How does that happen? Let’s back up a
little. If the water were not moving at all—if, instead of a river, the pillar
stands in a stagnant pond—then there is no pattern, since there is no
motionandnostreamlines.Wemustaskhowstill,uniformwaterbecomes
eddying flow. Let’s turn on the flow gradually and see what happens.
So here, then, is our idealized Seine: water flowing down a shallow
channel, which for simplicity we will assume to be flat-bottomed with
parallel, vertical sides. At slow flow rates, all the streamlines are straight
and parallel to the direction of flow—in other words, any little particle
that traces the flow, such as a leaf floating on the river surface, will
follow a simple, straight trajectory (Fig. 2.5a). At the edge of the ‘river’,
where the fluid rubs against the confining walls, we can imagine that
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 27
something more complicated might happen, but actually this need not
alter the picture very much,* and in any event we can ignore that if we
make the river wide and focus on the middle, where the streamlines are
parallel and all of the fluid moves in synchrony, in the same direction at
the same speed. Flows like this in which the streamlines are parallel are
said to be laminar. The flow here is uniform throughout the water’s
depth (again, we can ignore the region where the water drags against
the river bottom), so we can depict it simply in terms of two-dimensional streamlines.
Now it’s time to introduce the Pont Neuf, or, rather, the scientist’s
idealized version, which is a single cylindrical column standing in the
middle of the river (Fig. 2.5b). Clearly, some streamlines have to be
deflected around the cylinder. If the flow rate is very low, this can
happen smoothly: the streamlines part as they reach the cylinder and
converge again downstream to restore the laminar flow (Fig. 2.5b,c).
This creates a contained, lens-shaped region of disruption.
What happens if the flow rate increases? In the wake of the pillar, we
find that two little counter-circulating vortices, or eddies, appear
Fig. 2.5: Streamlines in the river. When fluid flow is slow and
undisturbed, a floating particle follows a straight-line trajectory (a). But
if an obstacle is placed in the stream, the water must pass around it to
either side (b). At low flow speeds, the flow remains identical in all
perpendicular layers, and so it can be represented in a single flat plane
(c). Upstream, the diverted streamlines converge again. But at faster
speeds, circulating vortices appear behind the obstacle (d), which grow
and elongate as the flow quickens its pace (e).
*A fluid will typically be slowed by friction where it touches the wall. If we think of it as being
divided into a series of parallel strips, the outermost strip may be arrested entirely by friction.
The strip next to it is slowed down by the motionless layer, but not stopped entirely; and so
on with successive strips, each slowed a little less. So the velocity of the flow increases
smoothly from the walls, where it is zero, to the middle of the flow—just as Leonardo said.
28 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
(Fig. 2.5d). The streamlines in the eddies are closed loops: there are
little pockets of fluid that have become detached from the main flow
and remain in place behind the pillar. A particle carried along in the
water would go round and round for ever if it got trapped in these
eddies. If the flow rate becomes still greater, the eddies grow and get
stretched out (Fig. 2.5e), but the flow outside of them remains laminar:
the streamlines eventually converge downstream and resume their
parallel paths.
It would be handy to have some way of measuring when these
changes happen. But we cannot simply say that, for example, the pair
of eddies appear at a flow speed of ten centimetres per second or
whatever, because in general this threshold also depends on factors
other than the fluid velocity, in particular the width of the pillar and the
viscosity of the liquid. However, one of the most profound and useful
discoveries of fluid dynamics is that flows can be described in terms of
‘universal’ measures that take all of these things into account. In this
case, let us assume that the flow is happening in a channel so wide that
the banks are very distant from the pillar and have no effect on the flow
there. Then we find that the flow velocity at which eddies first appear,
multiplied by the diameter of the pillar and divided by the viscosity of
the liquid, is always a constant, regardless of the type of liquid or the
dimensions of the pillar. This number has no units—they all cancel
out—but simply has a value of about four.
This is an example of a dimensionless number, one of the ‘universal
parameters’ that allows us to generalize about fluid flows without
having to take into account the specific details of our experimental
system. It is called the Reynolds number, after the British scientist
Osborne Reynolds who studied fluid flow in the nineteenth century.
It isn’t just a happy coincidence that this particular combination of
experimental parameters eliminates all units and gives a bare
number. Dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics are in fact ratios
that express the relative contributions of the forces influencing the flow.
The Reynolds number (Re) measures the ratio of the forces driving the
flow (quantified by the flow velocity) to the forces retarding it by
viscous drag. In our experiment, the size of the pillar and the liquid
viscosity stay constant, and so Re increases in direct proportion to
the flow speed.
So then, at a Reynolds number of four, the flow pattern changes
abruptly with the appearance of the pair of vortices. The new pattern
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 29
remains, albeit with increasingly elongated vortices, until Re reaches a
value of about 40. Then something new happens: the downstream
streamlines don’t all eventually become parallel, but instead there is a
persistent wavy undulation in the wake. This can be seen experimentally by injecting a coloured dye into the liquid from the rear side of the
cylinder, which is carried along in a narrow jet that more or less mirrors
the streamlines (Fig. 2.6a). As the Reynolds number (that is, the flow
rate) continues to increase, the waves get more pronounced, and the
peaks become sharper (Fig. 2.6b). Around Re ¼ 50, these crests break
and curl over into swirling vortices (Fig. 2.6c): an astonishing and very
beautiful pattern in which we can immediately see the characteristic
Fig. 2.6: At a flow rate corresponding to a Reynolds number of about 40, the wake of a flow past
a cylinder develops a wavy instability, revealed here by the injection of a dye. At higher flow speeds
this wavy disturbance develops into a train of vortices, called a Ka ´rma ´n vortex street (c,d). Above a
Reynolds number of around 200, the vortex street breaks up into a turbulent wake. (From Tritton,
1988).
30 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
traceries of Art Nouveau. In effect, the wake of the flow is continually
shedding eddies, first on one side and then on the other.
Although, as we have seen, structures rather like this can be seen in
Leonardo’s sketches, they do not seem to have been reported in a formal
scientific context until 1908, when the French physicist Henri Be ´nard
published a paper called ‘Formation of rotation centres behind a moving obstacle’. But Be ´nard’s work was not known to the German engineer
Ludwig Prantl when he made a study of cylinder wakes in 1911. Prantl
had a theory for such flows, and the theory said that the wake should
be smooth, rather like that in Fig. 2.5c. But when his doctoral student
Karl Hiemenz conducted experiments on this arrangement, he found
that the flow behind the obstacle underwent oscillations. Nonsense,
Prantl told him—clearly the cylinder isn’t smooth enough. Hiemenz
had it repolished, but found the same result. ‘Then your channel is not
perfectly symmetrical,’ Prantl told his hapless student, forcing him to
make further improvements.
At that time, a Hungarian engineer named Theodore von Ka ´rma ´n
came to work in Prantl’s laboratory in Go ¨ttingen. He began to tease
Hiemenz, asking him each morning, ‘Herr Hiemenz, is the flow steady
now?’ Hiemenz would sigh glumly, ‘It always oscillates’. Eventually, von
Ka ´rma ´n decided to see if he could understand what was going on.
A talented mathematician, he devised equations to describe the situation and found they predicted that vortices behind the cylinder could
be stable. As a result of this work, the trains of alternating vortices—
which, contrary to Prantl’s suspicions, are a real and fundamental
feature of the flow—are now known as Ka ´rma ´n vortex streets.
Where do the vortices come from? They spring out of the layer of fluid
moving past the surface of the cylinder, which acquires a rotating
tendency called vorticity from the drag induced by the obstacle. This
process is highly coordinated between the ‘left’ and ‘right’ sides of the
pillar, so that as one vortex is being shed, that on the other side is in
the process of forming (Fig. 2.7). Vortex streets are common in nature.
They have been seen imprinted on clouds as air streams past some
obstacle such as a region of high pressure (Fig. 2.8). They are generated
in the wake of a bubble rising through water, pushing the bubble first to
one side and then the other as the vortices are shed; this explains why
the bubbles in champagne often follow a zigzag path as they rise. Vortex
shedding from the wingtips of flying insects helps them to defeat the
usual limitations of aerodynamics: in effect, the insects rotate their
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 31
wings after a downstroke so that they receive a little push from the
circulating eddy this creates.
If the flow rate is increased still further, the vortices in the street begin
to lose their regularity, and the wake of the pillar seems to degenerate
into chaos. But in fact the orderliness of the flow comes and goes: an
observer stationed downstream would see more or less orderly vortex
streets pass by, interrupted now and then by bursts of disorderly turbulence. Above Re ¼ 200, however, an observer a long distance downstream would note that the ordered vortex patterns seem to have
vanished for good. Even then, vortex streets persist close to the pillar
itself, but they get scrambled as they move downstream. At Re ¼ 400,
however, even this organization gets lost and the wake looks fully
turbulent. This is the typical situation for a river passing around the
piles of a bridge—rivers generally have a Reynolds number of more
than a million—and so Leray will have strained in vain to discern much
of a pattern in the murky Seine.
Unstable encounters
The transformation of a smooth, laminar flow into the wavy pattern
shown in Fig. 2.6a illustrates a common feature of pattern-forming
systems: the sudden onset of a wobble when the system is driven hard
enough. I discussed several such wave-like instabilities in Book I, from
the fragmentation of columns of liquid to the appearance of oscillations
in a chemical reaction. What creates the wave in this instance?
Fig. 2.7: The Ka ´ rma ´ n vortex street arises from ‘eddy shedding’.
Circulating vortices behind the obstacle are shed from alternate sides
and borne along in the wake. Here one eddy is in the process of
forming just after that on the opposite side has been shed. (From
Tritton, 1988.)

PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 33
It is an example of a shear instability. When two layers of fluid slide
past one another, they rub against each other and experience a socalled shear force. In the tail of the wake immediately behind the pillar,
the fluid flow is slowed down, for here the flow is impeded. In the same
way, swimmers forced to manoeuvre around a lane-blocking obstacle
will take longer to reach the far end of the pool than identical competitors whose lanes are clear. This means that adjacent layers of fluid
move at different speeds, and so there is a shear force at the boundary.
This can amplify ripples that develop here by chance.
The situation is clearer if we consider adjacent layers of liquid flowing not just at different speeds, but in opposite directions.* Imagine
that a bulge appears at the interface. Where the bulge pushes out into
the next layer, the liquid there is ‘squeezed’ and flows faster, just as a
river flows more rapidly if it enters a narrow gorge. Meanwhile, the
bulge widens the layer from which it emerges, and the flow there is
slowed like a river becoming more broad and sluggish when it empties
onto a wide flood plain (Fig. 2.9). In 1738 Daniel Bernoulli showed that
*That may sound like a very different case, but in fact it isn’t. In the former case, it appears
from the perspective of the faster layer that the slower layer is going backwards, just as a car
that you’ve overtaken seems to be receding into the distance behind you.
Fig. 2.9: In a shear flow where two layers of fluid move past each
other, the boundary is susceptible to a wavy instability. On the concave
side of a bulge, the flow is slowed down, while on the convex side it is
speeded up (a). This causes a difference in pressure that pushes the
bump outwards, amplifying it (b). Eventually these waves peak and curl
into vortices. This is called the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.
34 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
the pressure exerted by a liquid lateral to the direction of flow decreases
as the flow gets faster. This explains why the shower curtain always
sticks to you: as the jet of water moves the layer of air between your skin
and the curtain, the pressure there falls and the curtain gets pushed
inwards by the air pressure on the other side.
This means that there is low pressure on the convex side of the bulge
and high pressure on the concave side, so the bulge gets pushed
outwards and accentuated. In other words, there is positive feedback:
the more the bulge grows, the greater its tendency to grow further. This
seems to imply that any bulge at the boundary of a shear flow will be
self-amplifying. But in practice, the viscosity of the liquid (a measure of
its resistance to flow) damps out the instability until the shear force
(here depending on the relative velocity of the two layers) exceeds some
critical threshold. What is more, the self-amplification is greatest at a
particular wavelength of undulation, and so this wavy pattern gets
‘selected’ from all the others. The result is that the shear flow develops
a regular series of waves (Fig. 2.10).
This shear instability was studied in the nineteenth century by two of
its greatest physicists, Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz, and it
is now known as the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. The waves become
sharply peaked as the structure evolves, and are then pulled over into
curling breakers, producing a series of vortices.* Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities are another of the patterning mechanisms that operate in the
atmosphere, appearing for example in clouds or air layers (Fig. 2.11a).
I have seen them myself in the sky above London. NASA’s Cassini
spacecraft captured a particularly striking example in the atmosphere
of Saturn, where bands of gases move past one another (Fig. 2.11b).
Plugholes and whirlpools
Shear instabilities can thus stir fluids into whirlpools. These flow-forms
range in scale from the mundane spiralling of bath water around the
plughole to the terrifying gyrations of tornadoes and hurricanes
(Fig. 2.12). The bathtub vortex puzzled scientists for centuries.
*I must stress that this is not how the vortices of a Ka ´rma ´n vortex street are made, however.
The waviness in Fig. 2.6 is indeed a shear instability, but the vortices grow from the edge of
the pillar, not from the peaks of the downstream waves.
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 35
Leonardo described it: the vortex, he said, ‘will be bored through down
to the hole’s outlet; and this hollow will be filled with air down to the
bottom of the water’. He asserted that this vortex must be a transient
phenomenon, because water is heavier than air and so the walls must
eventually collapse.
Where does the rotation come from? In 1955 a French hydraulic
engineer named Francis Biesel wrote that the slightest rotational

circulation ‘diffused throughout the fluid mass’ could become concentrated in the funnel-shaped outflow. ‘Experiment indicates that it is an
eminently unpredictable phenomenon’, he wrote. ‘It is also a particularly persistent one, quite difficult to counter.’ But if there’s no rotation
there to begin with, he said, it cannot be created from nothing.
A popular notion says that the rotation of the earth starts the bathtub
vortex spinning. But while it is certainly true that this rotation controls
the direction of the giant atmospheric vortices of cyclones, which
rotate counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise
in the Southern, the influence of the Earth’s rotation on a microcyclone in the bath should be extremely weak. Biesel claimed that it
cannot be responsible for the bathtub vortex because, contrary to popular belief, they may rotate in either direction at any place on the planet.
But is that really so? In 1962 the American engineer Ascher Shapiro at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claimed that he had consistently produced counter-clockwise vortices in his lab by first allowing

the water to settle for 24 hours, dissipating any residual rotational
motion, before pulling the plug. The claim sparked controversy: later
researchers said that the experiment was extremely sensitive to the
precise conditions in which it was conducted. The dispute has never
quite been resolved.
We do know, however, why a small initial rotation of the liquid develops into a robust vortex. This is due to the movement of the water as it
converges on the outlet. In theory this convergence can be completely
symmetrical: water moves inwards to the plughole from all directions.
But the slightest departure from that symmetrical situation, which
could happen at random, may be amplified because of the way fluid
flow operates. Flow may be transmitted from one region of fluid to
another because of friction. This is why you can stir your coffee by
blowing across the top, and why ocean surface currents are awakened
by the wind: one flow drives another. A small amount of rotation excites
more, and then more again...To sustain this process, however, the
nascent vortex needs to be constantly supplied with momentum, just
as you need to keep pushing a child on a swing to keep them moving.
This momentum is provided by the inflow of water towards the plughole: in effect, the momentum of movement in a straight line is converted to the momentum of rotation.
The plughole vortex is an example of spontaneous symmetry-breaking: a radially converging flow, with circular symmetry, develops into a
flow with an asymmetric twist, either clockwise or counter-clockwise
depending on the nature of the imperceptible push that gets the rotation under way. Setting aside Shapiro’s ambiguous experiments, this
initial kick seems to happen at random, and there is no telling which
way the bathtub vortex will spin.
Marine whirlpools have spawned many legends, from Charybdis of
the Odyessy to the Maelstrom of Nordic tales. Centrifugal forces act on
the spinning water to push the surface of a whirlpool into an inverted
bell-shape, which is embellished by ripples excited near the centre to
produce the familiar corkscrew appearance (Fig. 2.12a). Some of these
structures, like the Maelstrom and the vortex at St Malo in the English
Channel, are caused by tidal flows near to shore, which is precisely why
they are so hazardous to seamen. Poe’s terrifying account of a Norwegian fisherman’s Descent into the Maelstro ¨m (‘the boat appeared to be
hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a
funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth’) is uncannily
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 39
accurate not just in a pictorial sense but in terms of the underlying fluid
dynamics, suggesting that perhaps Poe took his information from a
real-life encounter.
Vortices appear not just in sluggishly flowing fluids but also in fully
turbulent ones. Although such flows seem disorderly and unpredictable, nevertheless the fluids retain a propensity to organize themselves
into these distinct, coherent structures. This was demonstrated by
Dutch physicists GertJan van Heijst and Jan-Bert Flo ´r at the University
of Utrecht, who showed that a kind of two-headed vortex (the technical
term is ‘dipolar’) can emerge from a turbulent jet. They fired a jet of
coloured dye into water whose saltiness increased with depth. This
gradient in saltiness meant that the water got denser as it got deeper,
which suppressed up-and-down currents in the fluid, making the flow
essentially two-dimensional: each horizontal layer flowed in the same
way. The initially disordered flow in the head of the jet gradually
arranged itself into two counter-rotating lobes (Fig. 2.13). And to
show just how robust these dipolar vortices are, van Heijst and Flo ´r
fired two of them at each other from opposite directions, so that they

density gradient keeps the flow essentially two-dimensional) organizes
itself into a coherent structure, the dipolar vortex. (Photos: GertJan van

collided head on. This might be expected to generate a turbulent frenzy,
but instead the vortices displayed a slippery resilience that somehow
makes you think of egg yolks. As they collided, they simply paired up
with their counterpart in the other jet and, without mixing, set off in
new directions (Plate 1).
The giant’s eye
One of the most celebrated and dramatic of the vortices found in a
natural turbulent flow has been gyrating for over a century. Jupiter’s
Great Red Spot is a maelstrom to cap them all: as wide as the Earth and
three times as long, it is a storm in Jupiter’s southern hemisphere in
which the winds reach speeds of around 350 miles an hour (Plate 2). It
is often said that the Red Spot was first observed in the seventeenth
century by Robert Hooke in England and by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in Italy. But it is not clear that either of these scientists saw today’s
Red Spot. Cassini’s spot, which he reported in 1665, was subsequently
observed until 1713, but after that the records fall silent until the
sighting of the present Red Spot in 1830. Vortices like this do come
and go on Jupiter—three white spots to the south of the Great Red Spot
appeared in 1938 and persisted until 1998, when they merged into a
single spot.* The Great Red Spot itself seems to be diminishing since its
observation in the nineteenth century, and it is very likely that one day
Jupiter’s eye will close again. How do these structures arise, and how
can they for so long defy the disruptive pull of turbulence?
The colours of Jupiter’s cloudy upper atmosphere are caused by its
complex chemical make-up: a mixture of hydrogen and helium with
clouds of water, ammonia, and other compounds. All this is stirred by
the planet’s rotation into a swirling brew, which is patterned even
before we start to consider the spots. The Jovian atmosphere is divided
into a series of bands marked out in different colours (Plate 3). Each
band is a ‘zonal jet’, a stream that flows around lines of latitude either in
the same or the opposite direction to the planet’s rotation. The Earth
has zonal jets, too: the eastward current of the trade winds in the
tropics, and the westward current of the jet stream at higher latitudes.
*In 2005–6 this turned red, presumably because its increased strength dredged up some red
material from deeper in the atmosphere. It has been dubbed Red Spot Junior.
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 41
On Jupiter, both hemispheres have several zonal jets travelling to the
east and west. The origin of these bands is still disputed, but they may
be the product of small-scale eddies pulled and blended into latitudinal
jets by the planet’s rotation.
Peter Olson and Jean-Baptiste Manneville have shown that a similar
banded structure can arise from convection in a laboratory model of
Jupiter’s atmosphere. They used water to mimic the fluid atmosphere
(since it has a similar density), trapped between two concentric spheres
25 and 30 centimetres across. The inner sphere was chilled by filling it
with cold antifreeze; the outer sphere was of clear plastic, so that the
flow pattern could be seen. The researchers simulated the effect of the
planet’s gravity by spinning both spheres to create a centrifugal force,
and added a fluorescent dye to the water so that the flow pattern could
be seen under ultraviolet light. They saw zonal bands appear around
their model planet because of convective motions. We will see in the
next chapter how such rolls and stripes are a common feature of
convection patterns.
The spot features in Jupiter’s atmosphere are formed at the boundary
of two zonal jets, where the movement of gases in opposite directions
creates an intense shear flow. The Great Red Spot circulates like a ball
bearingbetween the flows above and below (Fig. 2.14). There is now reason
to think that a single big vortex like this may be a very general feature
of this kind of turbulent flow. Philip Marcus from the University of California at Berkeley has carried out numerical calculations of the flow in a
Fig. 2.14: Jupiter’s Great Red Spot circulates between oppositely
directed zonal jets that encircle the planet.
42 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
thin annulus of fluid: a washer-shaped disk with a hole in the middle,
representing a kind of two-dimensional projection of one of Jupiter’s
hemispheres. The rotation itself sets up a shear flow: rings of fluid at
successively larger radial distances from the centre flow past each
other. Marcus found that when the shearing was high enough to
make the flow turbulent, small vortices would occasionally arise in
the circulating fluid. If they rotated in sympathy with the shear flow,
like the Great Red Spot, they would persist for some time; if they rotated
against the shear, they would be pulled apart. In a flow containing preexisting, large rotating vortices, a vortex rotating with the flow persisted
whereas one rotating against it was rapidly stretched and pulled apart.
The persistent vortex then proceeded to feed on smaller vortices with
the same sense of rotation that arose subsequently in the turbulent flow
(Plate 4a). If two large vortices with the ‘right’rotation were set up in the
initial flow, they would rapidly merge into one (Plate 4b).
These calculations suggested that, once formed, a single large vortex
is the most stable structure in this kind of flow. But how might it get
there in the first place? Inspired by Marcus’s calculations, Joel Sommeria, Steven Meyers, and Harry Swinney from the University of Texas
at Austin devised experiments to investigate this kind of flow in the
flesh, as it were. They used a rotating annular tank into which they
pumped water at various points in the tank’s base equally spaced from
the centre. Outlet ports located in the base of the tank allowed the fluid
to escape again. By using this pumping system rather than just filling a
plain tank with water, the interaction between flow induced by pumping and extraction at different radii and flow induced by rotation of the
tank set up counter-rotating zonal jets like those on Jupiter.
The researchers found that stable vortices appeared in the tank at the
boundaries of the zonal jets. The vortices were situated at the corners of
regular polygons: a pentagon for five vortices, a square for four and a
triangle for three. The number of vortices decreased as the shearing
(which depended on the pumping rate) got stronger; eventually only a
single large vortex could form (Fig. 2.15). Arising spontaneously from
small random fluctuations in the turbulent flow, this vortex then
remained stable and more or less isolated from the rest of the flow.
Dye injected into it was trapped (Plate 5); dye injected outside stayed
excluded. Occasionally other small vortices, rotating in the same sense,
appeared in the flow, lasting only for a short time before either merging
with others or, ultimately, being swallowed up by the large vortex—just
PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 43
as Marcus had found. This same process has been seen on Jupiter itself:
as they passed the planet in the early 1980s, the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft repeatedly saw small white spots approach the Great Red Spot from
the east and become trapped ‘in orbit’ around the spot’s edge before
finally merging with it (Fig. 2.16). We have good reason to think, then,
that Jupiter’s bleary eye is a fundamental feature of its turbulent skies.
Even if the present spot dissipates, another can be expected to emerge.
Many sides to the vortex
Not all whirlpools are round: some are triangular, square, hexagonal, or
shaped like other regular polygons. This surprising discovery was made
in 1990 by Georgios Vatistas, working at Concordia University in Montre ´al, Canada. Vatistas set a layer of water rotating in a cylindrical tank by
spinning a disk on the bottom of the vessel. As the disk got faster, the core
of the vortex whisked up in the water changed from circular to having a
many-lobed shape: first two lobes, then three, then four and so on
Fig. 2.15: In this experimental simulation of Jupiter’s atmospheric flow, a fluid is pumped into a

galaxies seem to have not just one but several dense cores: the Andromeda galaxy, for example, has a double core, while others have several.
Curiously, an analogous patterning process happens ‘in reverse’ for
spinning droplets of liquid suspended in a void. The Belgian physicist
Joseph Antoine Ferdinand Plateau, whose experiments on soap films we

PATTERNS DOWNSTREAM j 47
encountered in Book I, discovered in the 1860s that a spinning droplet
becomes deformed into a two-lobed ‘peanut’ shape when it rotates fast
enough. Plateau too was interested in astrophysical implications—
he wondered whether his droplet might mimic rapidly spinning stars
or planets. Richard Hill and Laurence Eaves of the University of Nottingham in England have performed a more sophisticated version of
Plateau’s experiment (which used droplets of oil suspended in a wateralcohol mixture) by using strong magnetic fields to levitate droplets of
water as big as grapes (14 mm in diameter). They spun these drops by
passing an electric current through them to create a sort of ‘liquid
motor’. Hill and Eaves saw the droplets develop three, four and five
lobes—crudely speaking, becoming triangular, square and pentagonal—as the spinning got faster. It seems possible that some fastspinning asteroid-like objects in the so-called Kuiper belt beyond the
orbit of Pluto, some of which are piles of rubble held together loosely by
gravity, might also have three lobes. For both vortices and droplets,
then, rotation can break the symmetry, transforming an initially circular
object into one with ‘corners’.

Polygonal vortices do seem to exist in nature. The eyes of hurricanes
have been sometimes seen to be many-sided, with shapes ranging from
triangular to hexagonal. Hurricane Ivan, which ravaged Grenada and
Jamaica in 2004, had a roughly square eyewall as it approached the US
east coast (Fig. 2.18). And the north pole of Saturn is surrounded by a
remarkable hexagonal structure in the giant planet’s atmosphere,
which was discovered in the 1980s by the Voyager spacecraft
(Fig. 2.19). Could these be the same structures as those we can see in
a bucket of swirling water? This is not clear: the comparison only really
holds if the flows have similar Reynolds numbers, whereas those on a
planetary scale tend to have rather larger values of this quantity than
those in the lab experiments. We have yet to fully understand why
Saturn is hexed.

How Convection Shapes
the World
O NE described formally in 1900 by the French physician Henri Be ´nard, but people had surely been conducting it inadvert- of the classic experiments in pattern formation was first
ently for centuries in the kitchen. As I explained at the beginning of
Book I, if you gently heat oil in a shallow pan, it starts to circulate in
roughly hexagonal cells (Fig. 3.1). These may be revealed by adding
powdered metal to the pot, so that the flakes glint as they rise and fall
with the flow (though not, of course, if you have culinary aims in mind).
D’Arcy Thompson was delighted with Be ´nard’s discovery, although
he tells us that the German doctor Heinrich Quincke had seen these
tourbillons cellulaires (cellular swirls) long before. He says that
Fig. 3.1: When heated

The liquid is under peculiar conditions of instability, for the least fortuitous excess
of heat here or there would suffice to start a current, and we should expect
the system to be highly unstable and unsymmetrical...[but] whether we start
with a liquid in motion or at rest, symmetry and uniformity are ultimately attained.
The cells draw towards uniformity, but four, five or seven-sided cells are still to be
found among the prevailing hexagons. ..In the final stage the cells are hexagonal
prisms of definite dimensions, which depend on temperature and on the nature
and thickness of the liquid layer; molecular forces have not only given us a definite
cellular pattern, but also a ‘fixed cell-size’...When bright glittering particles
are used for the suspension (such as graphite or butterfly scales) beautiful optical
effects are obtained, deep shadowsmarkingtheoutlinesandthe centresofthecells.
This is not only an elegant description but a perceptive one. Thompson
points out that where we might expect turbulent chaos, we get geometric order, and moreover that there is a selection process that determines
the size of the pattern features. It set him thinking about hexagonal
patterns in layers of living cells, in soap froths, in the pores that perforate the shells of marine micro-organisms, and in the cloud patterns
of a ‘dappled or mackerel sky’.
To understand Be ´nard’s observation, we need first to know what
Thompson meant when he spoke about the ‘peculiar conditions of
instability’ that the heated liquid experiences. The least amount of
excess heat in any part of the liquid layer, Thompson says, will start a
circulating current—because of convection.
A fluid is generally less dense when warm than when cool.* Its
molecules are all jiggling with thermal energy, and the hotter they are
the more they jiggle. This means that each takes up more space, so the
warmed fluid expands and becomes less dense.
Now let’s think about what this implies for a pan of fluid heated from
below. The lower layer of fluid becomes warmer and less dense than
that above it. This means it is more buoyant: like a bubble, it will have a
tendency to rise. By the same token, the cooler, denser fluid on top will
tend to sink. This imbalance in density is the origin of convection
currents, like those that carry dust aloft above radiators in a heated
room. The dust traces out the otherwise invisible motions of the air.
But if all the lower layer in our pan has the same buoyancy, while all
the fluid at the top has the same ponderousness, how can they change
*This is almost always the case, but, perversely, water provides an exception. It is one of the
characteristic oddities of water that it is densest not when it is coldest—at the freezing
point—but at four degrees centigrade above freezing. But if we are talking about heating up
water from room temperature, this quirk is irrelevant: above 4 8C, water behaves ‘normally’,
becoming less dense the warmer it gets.

places? Clearly the two layers cannot merely pass through one another.
The uniformity—the symmetry—of the system hinders convection
from getting under way. The only solution is to break this symmetry.
What Be ´nard saw was that the uniform fluid breaks up into cells in
which the liquid circulates from top to bottom and back again. Be ´nard’s
cells were polygonal, but if the heating rate at the base of the pan is only
just sufficient to get convection started, the cells are instead usually
sausage-shaped rolls (Fig. 3.2). Seen from above, these give the fluid a
striped appearance (Fig. 3.3a). Neighbouring roll cells circulate in opposite directions, so that the fluid at alternate boundaries is sinking and
rising. The symmetry of the fluid is broken when these cells appear.
Before that, every point at the same depth in the fluid was the same as
any other. But when convection starts, a microscopic swimmer would
find himself in a different situation in different locations: either buoyed
up by liquid rising from below, carried along by the flow at the top of a
cell, or dragged down by sinking liquid. And as D’Arcy Thompson
perceived, this roll pattern has a characteristic size: the cells are about
as wide as the fluid is deep.
In 1916 Lord Rayleigh asked what triggered the sudden appearance of
this convection pattern. It does not arise as soon as the bottom water is
warmer than that at the top, even though this creates the imbalance in
densities. Rather, the roll cells appear only above a certain threshold in
the temperature difference between top and bottom. This threshold
depends on the nature of the fluid—for example, how viscous it is and
how rapidly its density changes with temperature—and also on the
fluid’s depth. That sounds discouraging, because it seems to imply
that, if we are seeking to understand why convection starts, the answer
depends on the precise details of our experiment.
Fig. 3.2: Convection roll cells, which form in a fluid confined between
a hot bottom plate and a cooler top plate. The cells are roughly
square in cross-section, and adjacent cells rotate in opposite directions.
52 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
But Rayleigh showed that the various factors that determine the
critical threshold for convection can be combined in a single quantity
that supplies a universal criterion for whether or not convection occurs.
Like the Reynolds number, this parameter, now called the Rayleigh
number, Ra, has no units: it is another dimensionless variable of fluid
dynamics. And like the Reynolds number, the Rayleigh number specifies a ratio of forces—specifically, of the forces that promote convection
(the buoyancy of the fluid, which is determined in part by the temperature difference between the top and bottom) and those that oppose it
(the frictional forces that arise from the fluid’s viscosity, and the fluid’s
ability to conduct heat and thus to even out the temperature imbalance
without flowing at all). The reason convection does not arise as soon as
the bottom becomes warmer than the top is because the fluid motion
is opposed by friction. Only when the driving force (the temperature difference) becomes big enough to overcome this resistance
do the convection cells appear. This corresponds to a Rayleigh number
of 1,708.
Just as we saw when using the Reynolds number to characterize fluid
flow, the beauty of treating the problem of convection by reference to
the Rayleigh number is that this number is then all we need worry
about (well, nearly all, as we shall see). Two different fluids in vessels of
different sizes and shapes will convect (or not) in the same way when
their Rayleigh number is the same. This means that one can map out
the generic behaviour of convecting fluids as a function of their Rayleigh number, without having to worry about whether the fluid is water,
oil, or glycerine. Rayleigh also showed that the roll cells that appear at
the onset of convection have a particular width that is very nearly (but
not exactly) equal to the depth of the fluid, so the rolls have an approximately square cross-section.
If the Rayleigh number is increased beyond its critical value of 1,708
to a value of several tens of thousands, the convection pattern can
switch abruptly to one in which there are essentially two sets of perpendicular rolls (Fig. 3.3b). At still higher values of Ra, the roll pattern
breaks down altogether and the cells take on a random polygonal
appearance called a spoke pattern (Fig. 3.3c). Unlike the rolls, this
pattern is not steady: the cells continually change shape over time. It
is, in fact, a turbulent form of convection.
The theory of fluid dynamics, which I shall outline in Chapter 6,
supplies equations for describing flow that are extremely hard to solve
ON A ROLL j 53
unless you make some simplifying assumptions. Rayleigh did just that
for his analysis of convection. He considered a fluid trapped between
two parallel plates and filling the gap entirely, so there is no free surface
(as I showed in Fig. 3.2). Convection that takes place under this circumstance is now called Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection. Rayleigh also
assumed that (among other things) only the density of the fluid
changes with temperature—all its other properties stay the same. We
know that for most fluids this is not true: they get less viscous and more
runny when they are heated, for instance. And most importantly of all,
Rayleigh assumed that the temperature gradient—the way in which the
temperature changes from bottom to top of the fluid layer—stays
constant and uniform throughout. But a rising blob of hot fluid carries
heat up with it, and a cool sinking blob can cool down the lower
regions. In other words, the motion of the fluid alters the very force
Fig. 3.3: The complexity of convection patterns increases as the driving force—the temperature
difference between the top and the bottom of the vessel, measured as a quantity called the Rayleigh
number—increases. First there are simple roll cells (a). At higher Rayleigh numbers, roll cells
develop in the perpendicular direction too, so that the pattern consists of roughly square cells (b).
At still higher Rayleigh numbers, the pattern becomes irregular (turbulent) and changes over time
(c). (From Tritton, 1988.)
54 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
driving that motion (the temperature gradient). Rayleigh couldn’t find
an easy way to take this into account.
Rayleigh found that, as Ra is increased beyond the critical value (that
is, as the heating becomes fiercer), there is no longer a uniquely stable
shape for the convection cells: rolls may appear that are either wider or
thinner than those at the threshold itself. Physicists call these different
patterns ‘modes’—they are rather like the different acoustic oscillations
that can be excited in an organ pipe or a saxophone’s horn. Typically,
the harder you blow into a saxophone, the more acoustic modes become excited and the more harmonically rich the note becomes. Rayleigh’s treatment of convection shows how to calculate the range of
modes that may be excited for a particular value of Ra.
In view of all its assumptions, Rayleigh’s theory is surprisingly effective. It predicts correctly not only under what conditions convection
starts, but also what the maximum and minimum size of the convection
cells is. But within those bounds it cannot tell us anything about the
shape of the cells; in fact, it cannot even show they will be roll-shaped.
Moreover, to know whether a particular convection mode is truly stable,
one also needs to know if all imaginable disturbances (a snake-like
‘shudder’ of the roll cells, say) will die out or grow bigger. Working out
the stability of the various modes in the face of all such disturbances is
no mean task, involving mathematical analysis considerably more
complicated than that employed by Rayleigh. During the 1960s and
1970s the German physicist Friedrich Busse and his colleagues performed these difficult calculations. They discovered all manner of instabilities that might destroy the parallel sets of rolls. Busse gave these
instabilities descriptive names, such as zig-zag, skewed varicose, and
knot. They hedge in the options for roll cells, constraining much more
tightly the permitted size and the values of Ra for which they may occur.
In fact, straight roll cells are the exception rather than the rule in
experiments on Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection. Generally they are found
only in long, narrow trays of fluid. Even here the rolls can become
deformed, and strange things happen at the ends (Fig. 3.4). These edge
effects can have a profound influence on the patterns in the rest of the
system, which makes it harder for theorists to predict how a convecting
fluid will behave and introduces a whole palette of new patterns.
In a circular vessel, parallel rolls are occasionally observed (Fig. 3.5a)
but often these become distorted into a pattern that resembles the old
Pan Am logo (Fig. 3.5b). This is because rolls are usually more stable when
ON A ROLL j 55
theymeetaboundarywallatrightangles,sotherollsbendattheirendsto
try to satisfy that condition. Another option is for the rolls to adapt
themselves to the shape of their environment: by curling up into concentric circles, they can avoid having to meetany boundaries at all (Fig. 3.5c).
Rolls may also break up into polygonal cells, which can be regarded as a
combination of two or more intersecting roll arrays. Square, triangular,
and hexagonal patterns (Fig. 3.6) have all been observed; the latter are
particularly common. All these patterns are predicted by Busse’s complicated calculations.
Because of this rich diversity of patterns available to the convecting
fluid, it is not easy to predict which will be produced in any given experiFig. 3.4: Convection cells in a rectangular vessel. Parallel roll cells are
commonly distorted by the vessel’s edges. Here the rolls have a slight
wavy undulation, and at the ends of the vessel they break up into
square cells. (From Cross and Hohenberg, 1993, after LeGal, 1986.)
56 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
ment. When several alternative patterns are possible in principle for a
particular set of conditions, which is selected may depend on how the
system is prepared—that is, on theinitial conditions and the way in which
these are changed to reach a specific set of experimental parameters.
Pattern formation is then dependent on the past history of the system.
Fig. 3.5: In a circular dish, roll cells take a variety of shapes. They may remain parallel (a), or
curve gently into a pattern resembling the old Pan-Am logo (b) to reduce the angle at which
the rolls meet the wall. There are no such intersections at all if the cells take on the form
of concentric circles (c). In (a) the fluid is carbon dioxide gas, in (b) it is argon gas, and in
(c) water. (Images: a and c, David Cannell, University of California at Santa Barbara; b from

disordered patterns that constantly change over time (a). Several
characteristic types of ‘defect’ can be identified in these patterns (b).
(Image: a, David Cannell, University of California at Santa Barbara.)
58 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Some convection patterns also change over time. In cylindrical
dishes, the regular patterns described above are unusual; more often
the convection cells form an irregular network of worm-like stripes
which shift position constantly (Fig. 3.7a), like a mutable fingerprint.
Although these patterns are disordered, nonetheless they clearly retain
some vestiges of a pattern with identifiable features, such as the way all
of the wavy rolls tend to intersect the boundaries more or less at right
angles. One way of looking at this pattern is to see it as a set of parallel
rolls disturbed by lots of ‘defects’ where the rolls are misaligned or
broken. These defects can be classified into several types (Fig. 3.7b—
you should be able to spot all of these in a). All of them are familiar from
the physics of crystals, where analogous flaws crop up in the alignments of rows of atoms. Such defects can also be found liquid crystals,
in which rod-shaped molecules become aligned with each other like
floating logs (Fig. 3.8). They are seen, too, in the patterns formed by the
buckling of skin that give rise to real fingerprints (see Book I, page 254).
While some of the cores of these curving patterns consist of concentric
rolls like those in Fig. 3.5c, others are spirals. Convection spirals
may consist of a single coiled roll cell or of two or more intertwined
coils (Fig. 3.9; here you can see the double-coiled structure by looking
Fig. 3.8: Dislocations and other defects can be seen in the patterns
formed by liquid crystals. Here, each ‘cell’ corresponds to a region of
the liquid in which the rod-like molecules are aligned with one another

the material with polarized light. Each sinuous domain here is just a few
thousandths of a millimetre wide. (Photo: Michel Mitov, CEMES,

at the centre). Researchers at the University of California in Santa
Barbara have seen such spirals with up to 13 arms.
Surface matters
Henri Be ´nard saw not stripes but polygons in a convecting liquid.
Hexagonal patterns do appear in Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection, where
they can be regarded as the intersection of three roll-like patterns. But
Be ´nard himself did not study Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection in the strict
sense, because Rayleigh’s theory applies to a fluid filling the space
between two plates whereas Be ´nard’s fluid was a shallow layer with a
free surface exposed to air. This surface has a surface tension, the
influence of which may dominate pattern formation.
The surface tension of a liquid changes with temperature: typically,
the cooler the liquid, the larger its surface tension. If the temperature of
Fig. 3.9: Spiral convection looks very similar to concentric roll cells,
except for a defect at the pattern’s centre where the distinct spiral cells
meet. Notice that the spirals also contain other defects—two are
evident around the middle of the pattern in the lower left and right. The
spiral structures are not stationary, but rotate slowly. (Image: David
Cannell, University of California at Santa Barbara.)
60 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
a liquid surface varies from place to place, the stronger surface tension
in the cooler regions pulls warmer liquid towards it—in other words,
the liquid flows across the surface from hot to cold. Upwelling of hot
fluid due to buoyancy-driven convection can set up temperature differences at the surface: the fluid is hotter over the centre of a rising
plume than it is all around. If the resulting imbalance in surface tension
is the same in all directions around the plume’s centre, there can be no
surface-tension-driven flow because the forces pull equally in all directions. But any tiny, chance disturbance of this horizontal balance of
surface tensions triggers a symmetry-breaking transition that leads to
surface flow. As the fluid is pulled laterally across the surface to regions
of higher surface tension, more fluid is pulled up from below to replace
it. So, again, there is an overturning circulation; but now it is driven by
surface tension rather than by buoyancy.
Fluid flows induced by surface-tension differences were studied in
the nineteenth century by the Italian physicist Carlo Marangoni, and
they now carry his name. Whether or not a flow will be created by such
a difference depends on the balance between the pull of the surface
tension and the resisting influences of viscous drag and heat diffusion
(which neutralizes the surface-tension difference). And so there is a
Fig. 3.10: Marangoni convection takes place in liquids with a free
surface. Although it gives rise to hexagonal cells like those that can be
seen in Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection, the origin of the pattern is
different. It results from imbalances in surface tension owing to
variations in temperature at the liquid surface. This makes the liquid
surface pucker up as liquid is pulled from the centre to the edges of the
cells.
ON A ROLL j 61
critical threshold for Marangoni convection, determined by a dimensionless quantity called the Marangoni number, a measure of the ratio
of these opposing forces.
Convection in Be ´nard’s experiment is dominated by the Marangoni
effect, which sustains the flow and determines the pattern of the convective cells. This means that the onset of convection cannot be predicted in this case by Rayleigh’s theory. What’s more, the most stable
pattern consists not of roll cells but of hexagonal cells, in which warm
fluid rises in the centre, is pulled outwards over the surface by the
Marangoni effect, and sinks again at the hexagon’s edges (Fig. 3.10).
The differences in surface tension pucker the liquid surface, counterintuitively depressing it in the middle of the cells (where the fluid is
rising) and raising it at their edges (where the fluid sinks).
Rearranging the elements
D’Arcy Thompson suspected that convection patterns might explain
the way skies become dappled with clouds. He was right, for the
atmosphere is for ever churned by convection currents, and clouds
are their progeny. The atmosphere loses heat by radiation from the
upper layers, while sunlight absorbed by the ground and radiated as
heat warms up the lower layers. This warm air rises, and often carries
with it water vapour evaporated from the Earth’s surface. As the air
cools, the vapour condenses into droplets that reflect sunlight, creating
a dense white blanket that becomes puffed into billows, or spreads in a
sheet, or gathers into all sorts of strange shapes that people have
mistaken for portents or UFOs.
When atmospheric circulation becomes spontaneously patterned,
the clouds follow suit. Where warm, moist air rises at the edge of a
convection cell, water vapour condenses at these boundaries, while dry,
cold air sinks in the middle. The result is an array of cells traced out in a
web of clouds, with clear sky at their centres (Fig. 3.11a). If the circulation happens in the opposite sense, the warm air rising in a central
plume that diverges at the top, then the cells have cloudy centres
separated by a network of open edges (Fig. 3.11b). Alternatively, the
convection cells might be roll-shaped, giving rise to parallel rows called
cloud streets (Fig. 3.11c). Rayleigh’s theory of convection cannot accurately describe these atmospheric motions, because some of the
62 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
assumptions he made about the behaviour of the fluid are violated
rather strongly by air. The roll cells that produce cloud streets, for
example, are typically much wider than they are deep, unlike the
roughly square-profiled rolls of Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection.
On much larger scales, vast atmospheric convection cells are set up by
the differences in temperature between the tropics and the polar regions.
These cells don’t have a simple, constant structure, and moreover they

open-centred (a), closed (b), and roll cells (cloud streets) (c). (Photos:

ON A ROLL j 63
are distorted by the Earth’s rotation. Nevertheless, they do create characteristic circulation features such as the tropical trade winds and the
prevailing westerly winds of temperature latitudes. The English astronomer Edmund Halley first proposed in the seventeenth century that
convection owing to tropical heating drives atmospheric circulation,
and for some time afterwards scientists believed that a single convection
cell in each hemisphere carried warm air aloft in the tropics and bore it to
the poles, where it cooled and sank. We now know that is not the case.
There are in fact three identifiable cells in the mean hemispheric circulation of the lower atmosphere: the Hadley cell, which circulates between
the equator and a latitude of about 308; the Ferrel cell, which rotates in
the opposite direction at mid-latitudes; and the polar cell, which rotates
in the same sense at the pole (Fig. 3.12). The polar and Ferrel cells are
both weaker than the Hadley cell and are not clearly defined throughout
all the seasons. Where the northern Hadley and Ferrel cells meet, the
effect of the Earth’s rotation drives the strong westerly jet stream.
The oceans are also stirred by convection patterns. Like the atmosphere, they are warmed in the tropics and cooled in the polar regions.
This helps to establish a vast conveyor-belt circulation from the tropics
to high latitudes, and the warm water carried polewards in the Gulf
Stream at the top of the North Atlantic convection cell brings with it
Fig. 3.11: (Continued).
64 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
heat that keeps northern Europe temperate (Fig. 3.13). This circulation
pattern is not purely thermal (heat-driven), however. The density of sea
water is also determined by the amount of dissolved salt it contains: the
more saline the water, the denser it is. The salinity depends on evaporation, which removes water vapour and leaves behind saltier water, and
also on freezing, since ice doesn’t accommodate much salt. Thus the
large-scale pattern of ocean convection is influenced by evaporation in
the tropics and freezing at the poles: together, these processes give rise
Fig. 3.12: Large-scale convection in the Earth’s atmosphere is
organized into three roll-like cells in each hemisphere: the Hadley
cell between the equator and about 308 latitude, the Ferrel cell at

to the so-called ocean thermohaline (‘heat-salt’) circulation that regulates the Earth’s climate.
As well as elaborating the sky and sea, convection shapes the slow
rock of the solid Earth. Our planet is a vast convecting vessel filled with
a fluid that is hotter at the bottom than the top. Yes, it really is a fluid:
the rocky mantle between the crust and the core is hot enough to flow
like a very sluggish liquid. The planet’s molten core creates temperature
of almost 4,000 8C at the mantle’s base, nearly 3,000 kilometres beneath
our feet, while the top of the mantle (varying in depth from a hundred
to just over ten kilometres) has a temperature of several hundred
degrees. In addition, the mantle contains many radioactive substances
that are gradually decaying and releasing their nuclear energy, heating
the fluid mantle from within. Even though the mantle is extremely
viscous, it has a Rayleigh number of several tens of millions, and so is
convecting turbulently: there are no well-ordered roll-like convection
cells here, and the pattern shifts over geological time. This is what
makes geophysics so interesting; indeed, you could say that it is
what gives our planet a geological history, in the sense that the map
of its surface is always shifting. The tectonic plates of the Earth’s hard
outer shell are carried along at the tops of the convection cells, and
their changing positions trace out the past motions of the deep Earth.
Mantle convection continuously rearranges the mosaic of the continents, ripping open new seas and instigating cataclysmic collisions.
When, for example, a new surge of hot, upwelling mantle appears in
the middle of a plate, as it is doing in modern East Africa, the crust is
pulled apart and great rift valleys form in the divide. Elsewhere plates
are pushed together, and mountain ranges like the Himalayas are
created by the buckling of the crust. Some plate convergences may
force one to plunge down beneath the other in a process called subduction, and the groans and judders of the sinking plate are felt at the
surface as earthquakes. The tectonic plates are not passive in all this:
their presence at the top of the overturning convection cells may
influence the shape and disposition of the motions beneath.
The convection patterns in the mantle are further complicated by the
fact that the Earth is not a set of parallel plates or a cylindrical dish, but
a sphere. The patterns of convecting fluids within a sphere are not well
studied for low Rayleigh numbers, let alone for turbulent motions.
What is more, we do not know for sure how the mantle is structured.
Some of the seismic shock waves released by earthquakes come boun-
66 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
cing back towards the surface from a boundary at a depth of 660–670
kilometres, which appears to split the mantle into two concentric
shells. Most geologists believe that at this boundary there is a change
in the crystal structure of the mantle material, brought about by the
intense pressures and temperatures at these depths. Do the convection
cells punch their way straight through this boundary, or do cells circulate independently in the upper and lower mantle?
Exploring these literally deep questions experimentally is complicated and relies on a lot of indirect inference. Much of what we believe
about mantle convection has therefore been deduced from computer
simulations. These model the mantle as a grid of tiny compartments;
even if the overall flow pattern is complex, the flow in an individual
compartment can be assumed to be relatively simple and may be
calculated quite easily. What the simulation produces depends on
what assumptions go into it: whether convection is layered or not,
whether some material can pass between the layers, how much internal
heat is supplied by radioactive decay, whether you include rigid tectonic plates on top, and so on.
One conclusion seems to be fairly general, however: the rising and
sinking flows of mantle convection are not equivalent. The sinking fluid
forms sheet-like structures called mantle slabs, which plunge back into
the depths at subduction zones. It is tempting to regard the oceanic
fissures where hot magma wells up to form new ocean crust, such as
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that cleaves the Atlantic almost from pole to pole
or the East Pacific Rise off the west coast of South America, as the
corresponding counterflows: sheets of buoyancy-driven upwelling. But
these are not in fact intrinsic features of the convection pattern. Rather,
the hot rock is here simply being drawn up passively from rather shallow
depths by the movement of the crust away from the surface cracks, just as
blowing across the surface of a cup of coffee pulls the lower liquid up to
take the place of that which flows away horizontally. The fundamental
buoyancy-driven upwelling structures of mantle convection seem instead
to be plumes: cylindrical columns of hot, rising magma. These plumes
meet the surface at hotspots, which are centres of volcanic activity.
Mantle plumes have been investigated experimentally by simulating
the geological convection process in tanks of shallow viscous fluids
such as silicone oil and glycerine. These experiments show that convection plumes have a mushroom shape (Fig. 3.14a), with a broad head
and edges that twist into scroll-like spirals, capturing (‘entraining’) fluid
ON A ROLL j 67
within them. The plume head is like a three-dimensional version of the
twinned vortices of the turbulent jets we saw earlier (Fig. 2.13). They
may be seen inverted in the shape of ink drops descending through
water, as depicted in On Growth and Form (Fig. 3.14b), and they show
how again a turbulent liquid may organize itself into a robust and
orderly structure. D’Arcy Thompson considered these bell-like shapes
to be reflected in the forms of jellyfish and other soft marine invertebrates (Fig. 3.14c), and he speculated whether fluid flow might somehow be responsible for them.
The diameter of a mantle plume’s mushroom head depends on how
far it has travelled: if plumes begin close to the base of the lower mantle,
as proponents of whole-mantle convection believe, the head can be
around 2,000 kilometres across by the time it reaches the top of the
mantle. There it might burst forth in a huge outpouring of molten rock,
laying down vast ‘flood plains’ of basaltic rock. The basalt provinces
found in some parts of the world, such as the Deccan Traps in western
India, a region covering half a million square km and formed from more
than half a million cubic km of molten rock, might bear testament to the
surfacingofa deepmantle plume. Plumesthatrisefromshallowerdepths
have much smaller heads when they surface as hot spots. As the tectonic
plates pass across oceanic hot spots, the episodic discharge of blobs of
magma creates chains of islands, such as those of the Hawaiian group.
Why are the rising and sinking features of mantle convection so different? Partly this may be what comes of having an internal heat source
(radioactive decay) in the fluid. But the question also hinges on whether
the mantle convects as a whole or in layers: some computer simulations
have suggested that upwelling and downwelling flows are similar, and
roll-like, for a separately convecting upper mantle, whereas downwelling
sheets are formed if the mantle convects as a whole. The question is still
unresolved, and the evidence is conflicting. It looks as though mantle
slabs do penetrate through the 660-km boundary, uniting the upper and
lower mantle. But the boundary isn’t invisible to descending slabs : some
seem to get deflected there from their downward course, as though they
hit a wall that can’t easily be breached. Moreover, the chemical composition of igneous rocks at the Earth’s surface seems to require that some
parts of the mantle have been persistently isolated from others, whereas
whole-mantle convection should stir all the ingredients together. The
common view emerging now is that both styles of convection take
place. In simulations of the mantle by Paul Tackley, then at the California

these cold pools became large enough, they would suddenly flush
through to the lower mantle in an avalanche, creating a broad sinking
column that then spread in a vast pool above the core. It is now believed
that this episodic arrest and penetration at the 660-km boundary can
happen for rising plumes too (Fig. 3.15). One thing is for sure: whatever
the pattern of convection in the deep Earth, it isn’t anything like as
constant or as orderly as that in Be ´nard’s dish.

Convection seems to be an organizing force in geology at smaller scales,
too. Its characteristic polygonal imprint may be seen petrified into stone

and rock in the frozen wastes of Alaska and Norway. These remote tracts
may become covered with stone circles, labyrinths, networks, islands,
and stripes (Fig. 3.16), the pattern features typically a metre or so across.
When the Swedish geologist and polar explorer Otto Nordenskjold came
across these examples of ‘patterned ground’ in the early twentieth
century, he proposed that they are produced by circulating flows of
water in soil owing to seasonal cycles of freezing and thawing.
When the frozen ground is warmed, ice in the soil thaws from the
surface downwards, so the liquid water is warmer the closer it is to the
surface. For most liquids this would mean that the density simply
increases with depth, which is a stable arrangement. But as I indicated
earlier, water is not like other liquids: it is densest not at freezing point
(0 8C) but at 4 8C. So water warmed to a few degrees above freezing close
to the ground surface is denser than the colder water below it, and
convection will begin through the porous soil (Fig. 3.17). Where warmer
water sinks, the ice at the top of the frozen zone (the so-called thaw
front) melts, while the rising of cold water in the ascending part of the
convection cells will raise the thaw front. In this way, the pattern of
convection becomes imprinted into the frozen zone beneath it. Such
Fig. 3.15: Convection in the Earth’s mantle is driven by the heat of the core, and also by the heat
released as radioactive elements decay within the mantle. It tends to produce rising plumes of hot,
sluggish rock, and descending slab of cooler rock. The pattern of circulation appears to be modified
by a change in the chemical composition of the mantle at a depth of around 660 km, which creates
a barrier (probably only partial) to the flow.

polygonal patterns can also be found on the beds of northern lakes when
the water is shallow enough to freeze down into the lake bed (Fig. 3.18).
William Krantz and colleagues at the University of Colorado at Boulder have shown how this process might account for the orderly piles of
stones on the surface. They say that sub-surface stones are gathered in
the troughs of the corrugated thaw front, and then brought to the
surface by ‘frost heaving’, a process familiar to farmers, that happens
when soil freezes. So a field that freezes during a frost and then thaws

transferred to the ‘thaw front’, below which the ground remains frozen. Stones
gather in the troughs of the thaw front, and are brought to the surface by ‘frost

74 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
becomes littered with stones that trace out the pattern of convection
beneath the ground. Krantz and colleagues calculated the convection
patterns that may arise as water circulates through porous soils. They
found that polygonal (particularly hexagonal) patterns are favoured on
flat ground but that the convection cells are roll-like on sloping ground,
giving rise to rows of stones.
Mark Kessler and Bradley Werner of the University of California at
San Diego have concocted a more detailed computer model of the
process which shows how diverse the patterns can be and how they
may mutate one into another. They say that as the ground freezes from
the surface downwards, it does so faster where there are more stones
beneath the surface than where there is just soil, because the soil holds
moisture, which is slow to freeze. The net effect is for stones to be
pushed not only upwards but towards regions where other stones are
gathered, while soil gets pushed downwards and towards soil-rich regions. Thus, stone and soil get segregated. The stone domains also
become squeezed and elongated, especially if the soil is hard to compact.
Kessler and Werner’s model suggests that the patterns that result depend
on the concentration of stones in the soil, and also on the slope of the
ground and the tendency for stone domains to be elongated: they see
switches between stone holes, islands, stripes, and polygons as these
factors change (Fig. 3.19). The patterns are highly reminiscent of the
animal markings examined in Book I. And, curiously, polygonal networks
seem to follow rules for polygon-wall junctions analogous to those found
Fig. 3.19: The model of ‘sorted ground’ devised by Kessler and
Werner generates a wide range of stone patterns. In the top image, the
ratio of stones to soil decreases from left to right; in the middle, the
slope of the ground increases from left to right; and in the bottom

in soap foams (Book I, Chapter 2): three-way intersections with equal
angles of about 1208 are preferred, and four-way junctions are unstable.
These are strong hints that universal patterning rules are at play.
Convection may be seen on a grand scale on the Sun’s surface.
Sunlight comes from a 500-km thick layer of hydrogen gas close to
the star’s surface, which has a temperature of about 5,500 8C. This gas
is heated from below and within, and radiates its heat outwards from
the surface into space. So although it is about a thousand times less
dense than the air around us, it is a convecting fluid. Its Rayleigh
number is so high that we would expect it to be utterly chaotic and
unstructured. But photographs of the Sun’s surface show that, on the
contrary, the photosphere is pock-marked with bright polygonal regions called solar granules, surrounded by darker rims (Fig. 3.20).
These granules are the tops of convection cells: the bright centres are
regions of upwelling and the dark edges trace out cooler, sinking fluid.
They range in size from about 500 and 5,000 km across, making the
largest of them comparable to the size of the Earth. The pattern is
constantly changing, each cell lasting for only a few minutes, and its
existence in such a turbulent fluid shows that we still have a lot to learn
about the patterns of convection.

Riddle of the Dunes 4
When Grains Get Together
IT. E. Lawrence, went initially to the desert because of the army, and ended up staying in the army because of the desert. He was by all T would be easy to suppose that Ralph Alger Bagnold, rather like
accounts a good soldier, but one cannot help thinking his mind must
have been only half on the job, for he could not suppress his scientific
instinct for enquiry even in the most unlikely circumstances. Trained as
an engineer, he joined the British Army’s Royal Engineers in 1915 and
found himself posted to Egypt and India, where he fell in love with the
deserts. By the 1920s he was spending his leave exploring these ‘seas of
sand’, joining the 1929 expedition in search of the legendary city of
Zerzura west of the Nile that was led by La ´szlo ´ Alma ´sy, the Hungarian
nobleman who inspired Michael Ondaatje’s novel The English Patient.
‘We forgave Bagnold everything’, says Ondaatje’s Alma ´sy, ‘for the way
he wrote about dunes.’ That is indeed what Bagnold did, and with such
perception and insight that his 1941 book The Physics of Blown Sand and
Desert Dunes became the standard work on dune formation for many
decades. Inspired by his observations in Libya and informed by windtunnel experiments in England, Bagnold set out to explain how sand
grains are organized by the desert wind into structures ranging from
ripples the size of your fingers to undulations several kilometres across.
I cannot better Bagnold’s description of the basic dilemma posed by
the patterns of sand dunes. ‘Instead of finding chaos and disorder,’ he
wrote,
the observer never fails to be amazed at a simplicity of form, an exactitude of
repetition and a geometric order unknown in nature on a scale larger than that
of crystalline structure. In places vast accumulations of sand weighing millions
of tons move inexorably in regular formation, over the surface of the country,
growing, retaining their shape, even breeding, in a manner which, by its grotesque imitation of life, is vaguely disturbing to an imaginative mind.
What Bagnold is really saying here, though lacking the modern term, is
that dunes are self-organized. Wind alone has no intrinsic capacity to
make these stripes and crescents and other fantastic shapes, nor to set
their scale. Sand ripples and dunes are a conspiracy of grains, a pattern
that emerges from the interplay of windborne movement, collisiondriven piling up, and slope-shaving avalanches. The formation of sand
dunes is not only one of the most fertile of pattern-creating processes; it
is also something of an archetype, an exemplary demonstration of how
such patterns lie in wait in systems of many interacting parts, even
though no amount of close inspection of the components will reveal
them. We will see it is no coincidence that some of these patterns again
display characteristic, seemingly universal features that we have seen
before.
There is something deeply odd about grains and powders. They are
made of solid stuff—sand is mostly quartz, hard and crystalline—and
yet they flow. Sand supports our weight, but we can pour it from a cup.
An extreme and rather terrible example of this Janus aspect can be seen
during some earthquakes, such as that which shook the Marina district
of San Francisco Bay in October 1989. Many of the houses there were
sent tumbling as a segment of the San Andreas Fault slipped, and
although miraculously there was no loss of life, hundreds of millions
of dollars’ worth of damage was done. Yet elsewhere in the bay area
there was nothing like this degree of destruction. What brought low the
Marina district is that it was built on sand-rich landfill sites. When the
earth shook, these wet, sandy soils turned to a slurry that flowed like
treacle. This property of a granular substance, naturally enough called
liquefaction, is well known to seismologists and civil engineers. It is one
of the most dramatic manifestations of the fact that a granular substance is a peculiar state of matter.
Engineers and geologists urgently need to understand such behaviour, and not only to gauge earthquake hazards. All manner of industrial substances are routinely handled in the form of granular powders,
from cement to drugs to breakfast cereals, nails, nuts, and bolts. Graininess is everywhere in the geological world: it dictates the behaviour of
landslides, the transport of sediments, and the shape and evolution of
deserts, beaches, soils, and stony ground. There are old rules of thumb
for predicting how grains behave, but only in recent years have scientists begun to appreciate that to attain more fundamental understanding they must invent new physics.
Strange things happen in grains. Shaking together different kinds of
grain can mix them up, or, on the contrary, may have the opposite effect
78 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
of segregating them. Sound waves can bend around corners as they
travel through sand. The stress beneath a sand pile is smallest where
the pile is highest. Yet the pressure at the bottom of a tall column of
sand is the same regardless of the column’s height, which is why a sand
glass is a good timekeeper: the sand leaks out at a steady rate even
though the column gets smaller.
Shifting sands
Not all deserts are sandy, and not all sands are piled into dunes; but it is
the dune (Plate 6), which is found within only 20 per cent of the world’s
deserts, that defines our archetypal desert imagery. These seas of sand
are almost barren yet intensely beautiful, both terrifying and holy.
North Africans say that the desert is the Garden of Allah, scoured of
life so that he may walk there in peace.
Desert dunes range in width from a few metres to several kilometres,
and may themselves be organized into complex mega–dunes, sometimes
called draas after their name in North Africa, which can be up to several
kilometres broad. Moreover, dunes come in a variety of shapes; indeed,
there are so many varieties, with region-specific names derived from the
local language, that even geomorphologists have trouble keeping track of
them. At the smallest scale, the desert floor is wrinkled into little wavy
ridges typically about the width of your arm (Fig. 4.1). The crests of these
ripples may be spaced as little as half a centimetre apart, or as much as
several metres. Bagnold sought to explain why wind-blown sand gets
deposited in this wrinkled pattern. In today’s terminology, we would say
that what he proposed is an example of a growth instability driven by
positive feedback, so that small disturbances get bigger.
Let’s start with a flat sandy plain, across which a steady wind is
blowing. The wind continually picks up grains and dumps them elsewhere. If the wind blows always in the same direction, the plain is
gradually moved en masse upwind; the borders of deserts get shifted
around this way. But wouldn’t we expect the grains simply to be redistributed at random, so that the sand surface stays smooth?
That is what you might think; but Bagnold’s growth instability makes
the flatness prone to wrinkling. Imagine that, purely by chance, a little
bump appears where slightly more sand has been dumped than elsewhere—that is to be expected if the scattering of grains is truly random.
The windward side of the bump (called the stoss side) is now higher
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 79
than the ground around it, and so it captures more sand from out of the
breeze. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.2a, which shows that more lines,
representing the trajectories of wind-borne grains, intersect the stoss
face than they do a horizontal part of the surface with the same area.
This means that the stoss slope starts to grow even taller. Conversely,
fewer lines intersect the downwind (lee) side of the bump, where there
is an ‘impact shadow’—so the rate of grain deposition is smaller than
average here, and the slope gets accentuated rather than levelled out.
Once a bump is formed, therefore, it becomes self-amplifying.
That in itself seems to imply that the plain should become covered in
bumps at random locations. But the ripple pattern is not random: there
is a characteristic separation between ripples, a particular wavelength.
Where does that come from? It turns out that the formation of one
bump triggers the appearance of another one downwind, so that a
system of ridges propagates itself across the plain. This comes about
because the wind-blown grains bounce when they hit the desert floor.
The wind carries these bouncing sand grains downwind in a series of
hops, a process called saltation. The initial impact of a grain also
creates a little granular splash, throwing out other grains from the
surface which can then also be carried along by saltation.
Fig. 4.1: Ripples in sand are self-organized patterns formed as the wind picks up and transports
the grains. (Photo: .EVO.)
80 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Saltation could in itself be a smoothing-out process, since it means
that the grains that hit the surface get scattered again. But when a ripple
begins to form, the rate of downwind grain transport by saltation
becomes uneven. On a flat surface, saltation creates a flow of jumping
grains in the direction of the wind. But because there are fewer impacts
on the lee slope, those that occur at the foot of this slope send grains
jumping downwind (to the right in Fig. 4.2) that are not replenished by
grains jumping in from the other direction (to the left here). Therefore
the foot of the slope becomes excavated, and a new stoss slope develops
to its right (Fig. 4.2b, c). The overall effect is that one bump spawns
another just downwind, out of its impact shadow. So a single bump
grows into a series of ripples. As Bagnold put it, ‘a flat sand surface must
become unstable, because any small chance deformation tends to
become accentuated by the local sand-removing action of the saltation’.
Fig. 4.2: The formation of sand ripples involves a propagating
instability. Wind-borne grains rain down obliquely on the desert
surface. Where the surface slopes, more grains hit the windward (stoss)
side of the slope than the leeward side (a). Each grain scatters others
from the surface as it strikes, and travels downwind for a few short
hops before coming to rest—a process called saltation. The
accumulation of saltating grains at the slope crest means that the
leeward foot of the slope receives fewer grains than elsewhere, and so
it becomes excavated into a depression (b). This depression develops
into a new stoss slope, downwind of the first—and so a new ripple
begins to form (c).
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 81
He also suggested why the ripples have a characteristic wavelength:
this is determined, he said, by the typical distance that a saltating grain
travels before coming to rest (which in turn depends on the grain size,
the wind speed, and the wind angle). It now seems, however, that this
wavelength reflects a balance between rather more complex aspects of
the grain-transport process, and in reality there is usually a range of
wavelengths in any field of ripples.
There was, after all, a lot that Bagnold could not incorporate into his
simple theory. With computer models it is much easier to build in some
of these complexities. In such a model devised by Spencer Forrest and
Peter Haff from Duke University in North Carolina, the collision of a
grain with the sand surface is described by a so-called splash function,
which specifies the number of grains ejected in the impact, and their
velocities. As the grains are ‘fired’ at a flat bed of sand with a particular
speed and angle, ripples quickly begin to form (Fig. 4.3a). These have a
triangular cross-section, and rather than simply standing where they
first appear, they move in procession across the surface in the direction
of the wind, just as they do in real deserts. The ripples are not in any
sense being ‘blown along’ by the wind; instead, their synchronized
motion is an intrinsic consequence of saltation.
This motion ensured that differences in ripple size get evened out.
Smaller ripples travel faster than larger ones, simply because they
contain less material to be transported. But as they overtake larger
ripples, small ones ‘steal’sand from them until their sizes, and therefore
their speeds, are more or less the same: they are several hundred times
the width of individual grains (Fig. 4.3b).
In these simulations, deposition of grains meant that the sand bed
gradually increased in thickness. In the real world such beds can be
preserved for posterity, turned to permanent rock as the gaps between
the grains are filled in with a cement of minerals precipitated from
permeating water. Such sedimentary rocks are known as aeolian sandstone. (Aeolian means wind-borne, after the Greek god Aeolus, king of
the winds.) By artificially colouring the wind-borne grains at regular
intervals in their computer model, Forrest and Haff were able to deposit
‘stained’ layers which acted as markers to show how the deposited
material became distributed in the thickening bed. Depending on the
rate of deposition, they found various patterns (Fig. 4.3b,c), which
resemble those found in natural aeolian sandstones when some environmental change (for example, a change in the chemical composition
82 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
and thus the colour of the sandy material) allows material deposited at
different times to be distinguished.
March of the dunes
Seen from above, both small-scale ripples and fields of sinuous dunes
(Fig. 4.4) resemble the fingerprint-like stripes seen in convection and in
Fig. 4.3: Self-organized ripples forming in a computer model of windblown sand deposition. The ripples spring up from random irregularities
on an initially flat surface (a). The ripples move from left to right
because of saltation (the downwind jumping of grains). Small ripples
move faster than large ones, and so ripples may collide and exchange
grains until their size, speed and spacing are more or less uniform (b).
‘Stained’ grains injected at regular intervals trace out the patterns
formed by distinct layers (b,c). (Images: Peter Haff, Duke University,

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 83
some of the chemical ‘activator-inhibitor’ patterns I discussed in Book I.
(Look in particular at where ripples terminate or bifurcate in two.) The
biologist Hans Meinhardt at the Max Planck Institute in Tu ¨bingen suggests that, at root, the formation of these sand patterns is indeed akin to
an activator–inhibitor system, in which short-range ‘activation’ (initiation) of pattern features competes with their long-ranged inhibition
(suppression). The mounds of sand are formed by deposition of windblown grains. As a ripple or dune gets bigger, it enhances its own growth
by capturing more sand from the air. But in doing so, the dune removes
the sand from the wind, and also shelters the leeward ground, both of
which suppress the formation of other dunes in the vicinity. The balance
between these two processes establishes a constant mean distance
between dunes. And yet the pattern is not static: like sand ripples,
dunes are constantly on the move, shifting in a stately, writhing dance.
The pattern persists while its individual components change.
Probably the most familiar types of sand dunes are those that share the
same wavelike form as sand ripples, with linear, slightly wavy crests that lie

perpendicular to the wind direction. These are called transverse or linear
dunes (Fig. 4.4). Others form crests parallel to the prevailing wind: these are
longitudinal dunes. Some dunes have several arms radiating in different
directions: these are star dunes (Fig. 4.5a). Barchan dunes are crescentshaped, with their horns pointing downwind (Fig. 4.5b). Always on the
march, barchan dunes can merge into wavy crests called barchanoid
ridges. The motion of barchan dunes has been tracked by a remarkable
coincidence. In 1930, Ralph Bagnold took part in an expedition in northern
Fig. 4.5: Dunes have several characteristic shapes, including many-armed star dunes (a) and

Sudan during which the party camped one night in the lee of a barchan
dune. The next morning, they left their empty cans to be buried by the
shifting sands. Fifty years later, this abandoned rubbish was discovered
exposed on the desert floor by the American geologist Vance Haynes,
who was able to confirm its identity. The great barchan dune had
moved right over the pile and was now nearly 500 feet away.
These various dune types seem to be universal forms created by the
interaction of wind and grains. All of them have been seen traced into
the dust of Mars, along with others that are not familiar on our planet
(Fig. 4.6). The question, then, is not simply how dunes form, but how
the same basic grain-transport process (saltation) produces several
different forms.
Many models have been proposed to account for the shapes, sizes,
and arrangements of particular kinds of dune, some of them invoking
rather complex interactions between the evolving dune shape and the
wind-flow pattern. Bagnold suggested that longitudinal dunes might
be created by helical wind vortices stirred into the wind by convective
airflow above the hot desert surface. Another early pioneer of dune
studies, the British geographer Vaughan Cornish, suggested at the beginning of the twentieth century that star dunes form at the centre of
convection cells above the desert floor. It’s clear that the nature of the
wind, whether steady or varying in direction, fast or slow, has a big
influence on the type of dune it generates. The amount of sand available for dune-building is also important: transverse dunes may be
favoured if the sand supply is abundant, whereas longitudinal or barchan dunes form in a sparser environment. The fact that the dune itself
changes the flow of air around it as it grows adds a further level of
complication, as does the presence of vegetation or of complex underlying topography. So-called coppice dunes are formed when small
patches of vegetation accumulate sand, while climbing dunes, echo
dunes and falling dunes are caused by geographical features such as
hills.
Can we, then, say anything general about the factors that create
dunes? Bradley Werner has developed a computer model that generates
different dune types under different conditions. He imagines grains
being transported not individually but in slab-like ‘parcels’. These
initially lie scattered at random on a rough stony bed, and are picked up
randomly by the wind. After it has been carried a fixed distance, each
parcel has a particular chance of being re-deposited. The probability of
86 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
that is greater if the parcel hits sand-covered ground rather than stony
ground, because sand bounces by saltation over stony ground more
readily than over sandy surfaces—it may often ‘bounce’ until it finds a
softer landing. If the parcel is not deposited, it is carried on for the same
fixed distance before the possibility of being deposited arises again. If at
any point a pile of sand gets too steeply sloping, the slabs there slide

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 87
downhill until the slope is stable. This maximum allowed slope of a
sand pile is called the angle of repose; we will see later that it plays a
major role in the behaviour of grainy materials.
Now, Werner’s model is not self-evidently a good way to describe
windblown sand: it seems a little odd to parcel up the sand into irreducible slabs, for instance, or to assume that these always get carried
for the same distance before ‘hitting’ the ground again. Some of these
assumptions are understandable—dunes being so much bigger than
sand ripples, it’s not really feasible to simulate them grain by grain—but
that doesn’t mean they are reasonable. And yet the model seems to be
on to something, for with just these ingredients Werner was able to
reproduce all the major dune types: barchan, star, and linear dunes
(Fig. 4.7). When the wind was predominantly in a single direction,
dunes formed with their crests lying perpendicular to the wind (transverse dunes), whereas if the wind direction was more variable, the dunes
were oriented in the average direction of the wind (longitudinal dunes).
While it is likely that specific, local influences affect dune sizes and
shapes, Werner’s model has the appealing feature that the broad patterns that emerge are generic, not dependent on case-by-case details.
Within this picture, star and barchan dunes are as inevitable a feature of
nature’s tapestry as the branches of a river or the stripes of a zebra.
Hans Herrmann at the University of Stuttgart and his colleagues are
not convinced that dune formation is so simple. They say that some of
the dunes that appear to emerge from models like this are merely
transient structures, which will fade into a featureless bed of sand if
the model is run for long enough. They think that the key factors in dune
Fig. 4.7: A model of dune formation devised by Bradley Werner generates many of the common
dune types, including transverse and longitudinal linear dunes (a,b) and barchan dunes (c). Here I
show the contours of the deposited material. The shapes depend on the wind direction and
variability, indicated by arrows. (Images: from Werner, 1995.)
88 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
formation are actually rather subtle, tied up with the details of how the
wind-borne supply of sand varies from patch to patch and how a
nascent dune affects the airflow around it. Grains are not simply fired
down onto the desert surface along straight-line trajectories at a fixed
angle. Instead, dunes act like obstacles in a stream’s flow, bending and
reorganizing the streamlines. In particular, the airflow over the ridge of a
dune is a little like the water flow past a bridge that we saw in Chapter 2.
The streamlines bend around the obstacle, but in the wind-shadowed
lee of the dune a circulating vortex may form (Fig. 4.8). Bagnold
explained all this, and measurements of flow around real dunes have
shown that it is indeed what happens. It means that the leeward shadow
is not merely a ‘dead zone’ that no grains reach; the vortex here can
scoop sand from the lee, eroding the slope.
A dramatic consequence of this effect of fluid flow has been seen by
the physicist Atsunari Katsuki of Osaka University in Japan and his coworkers in experiments on the formation of artificial dunes. Dunes are
usually too big and slow-forming to study in the lab, but Katsuki and his
colleagues mimicked the process by suspending sand in flowing water,
which carried the grains down a ten-metre trough. This produced
barchan-shaped dunes a few centimetres in size. Just like real dunes,
these miniature versions moved gradually down the trough, horns first
(real barchans can move downwind at several tens of metres a year).
The speed of a dune depends on its size, smaller ones moving faster.
This means that small dunes formed behind big ones can catch up with
them and collide.
In some collisions, a large dune began to break up as a small one
approached it from behind, even before the two came into contact
(Fig. 4.9a). By the time the small barchan reached the big one, the larger
dune had split in two. This strange behaviour, Katsuki and colleagues
realized, was caused by a vortex of fluid stretching away from the lee of
the small dune, which eats away at the stoss slope of the big one.
Fig. 4.8: A vortex forms behind the crest of a dune and erodes the lee
slope.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 89
There were two other kinds of collision too, depending on the sizes
(both relative and absolute) of the colliding dunes (Fig. 4.9b,c). In one,
the dunes simply merge; but the other is perhaps the oddest of all: the
small dune appears to pass straight through the big one. How is that
possible, without the grains getting scrambled? According to Hans
Herrmann, who has used a computer model to simulate these dune
collisions, the grains do get scrambled: it only looks as though the small
one passes through. What really happens, Herrmann says, is that the
small dune cannibalizes the big one: it grows and slows down, while the
big dune shrinks and speeds up.
These simulations revealed yet another type of dune interaction: as
they collide, ‘baby’dunes are spawned from out of the horns of the big
one (Fig. 4.10a). Something like this may be responsible for clusters of
different-sized barchan dunes seen in nature, like one observed in the
coastal deserts of Peru (Fig. 4.10b).
Although the dunes of Mars are thought to form by basically the same
processes of wind-blown transport and saltation, there is an important
difference on the red planet: its atmosphere is about 100 times thinner.
Saltation occurs only if the friction of the wind on the grains is big
enough, and in a thinner atmosphere this happens only if the winds are
stronger. Saltation in the Martian atmosphere demands winds ten
Fig. 4.9: In experiments in a water flume that mimic the formation of
sand dunes, the collision of a small, fast-moving dune with a larger,
slower one could have several outcomes. The large dune could be split
in two as the small one approaches (a), the small dune could simply
merge (b), or it could apparently pass right through (c). (Photos: Endo

times the strength of those on Earth. But gales as formidable as that do
occur on Mars. Because the conditions of dune formation differ in this
way, so do the shapes of some of the dunes. Herrmann and his colleague Eric Parteli find that their model can reproduce some of the
Martian dune shapes unknown on Earth (Fig. 4.11).
Striped landslides
One intriguing feature of natural sand patterns—both small-scale ripples and large dunes—is that the sand grains are segregated by size into
Fig. 4.10: A computer model of dune formation suggests that another
result of these dune collisions can be the spawning of two barchan dunes
from the ‘horns’ of the large one (a). This might explain the clusters of
dunes seen in some deserts (b). (Photo and image: Hans Herrmann.)

on Mars, where the atmospheric pressure is lower but the wind speed
can be higher. Here the upper frames show real Martian dunes, and

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 91
different parts of the mound. In sand ripples, the coarsest grains tend to
accumulate at the crests and in a thin veneer coating the stoss face. For
large dunes it’s often the other way round: the finest grains collect at the
crests, and the coarsest in the troughs. As sand continues to rain down
so that ripples are gradually laid on top of each other, the result is a
series of stratified layers: a periodic alternation of coarse and fine grains
down through the sand bed.
How does this grain-size sorting occur? Robert Anderson and Kirby
Bunas from the University of California at Santa Cruz have shown that
it can be produced by saltation. They studied a model rather like that of
Forrest and Haff, except that it incorporated grains of two different
sizes, each with a different splash function: large grains ejected more
secondary grains, since their collisions were more energetic. The size
and speed of the impacting grain, as well as the composition of the bed
that it struck, also determined the relative mixture of small and large
grains in the ‘splash’. Thus the rules governing the impacts were fairly
complicated; but their net effect was that impacts tended to throw out
the smaller grains preferentially, and with higher speeds (which carried
them further away). The general effect of impacts was therefore to
make the surface of the sand bed coarser.
Because the stoss slope receives more impacts, it gets more coarsened
(Fig. 4.12a), as seen for real-world ripples. And since the larger grains
make smaller hops, they gradually make their way up the stoss slope and
jump just over the crest into a sheltered region at the top of the lee slope
within the impact shadow. Here they remain, protected from impacts,
while further coarse material gradually climbs on top of them. The smaller grains, meanwhile, make bigger leaps and so are propelled further over
the edge onto the lower parts of the lee slope. As a result, the crests of the
ripples are particularly enriched in coarse grains, again as seen in nature.
Notice that the ripples here are asymmetric, with a gently convex
stoss slope and a steeper, concave lee slope. This shape is much closer
to that of real sand ripples than are the triangular mounds of Forrest
and Haff’s model, showing that the more sophisticated treatment of
saltation and splashes does a better job of imitating the real process.
And because the ripples are not static but are slowly moving downwind,
the coarse material on the ripple crests is repeatedly buried and then
exhumed again at the foot of the stoss slope as the ripples pass over it:
the grains are for ever climbing mountains. So as the sand bed gradually
thickens, stratified beds are laid down in which coarse and fine layers
92 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
alternate (Fig. 4.12b), mimicking the graded layers of aeolian sandstone.
There is another, quite different way of using nature’s self-organizing
capacity to sort grains of different types into layers. As it is both simple and
reliable, I have used it several times in demonstration lectures to show
how easy pattern formation can be. In fact, the process is so simple that it
is astonishing it was apparently not described until 1995, when it was
discovered by Herna ´n Makse and Gene Stanley from Boston University
and their colleagues. All you do is to mix up grains of different sizes and
shapes—coarsely granulated sugar and fine sand will do (the pattern is
not easy to see unless they are differently coloured)—and pour them into
a heap. As the heap builds up and grains tumble down its slopes, the two
types of grain become segregated into layers parallel to the slope. This is
seen most easily by making a two-dimensional heap (a slice of the conical
mound) so that you can see the cross-section (Fig. 4.13). That can be done
Fig. 4.12: Grains of different sizes are often segregated in sand ripples
and dunes. Here a computer model reveals the tendency of sand ripples
to accumulate coarse grains (white) on the stoss slopes, and
particularly at their crests (a). When the deposited layer gradually
thickens, the sand deposit becomes stratified (b). (Images: Robert

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 93
by pouring the mixture* into the gap between two transparent sheets of
glass or perspex (Plexiglas). Once the heap grows big enough, there are
regular landslides down the slopes—and you will see, I suspect with
some amazement, the stripes unfurl before your eyes.
This pattern-formation seems to deny intuition: it is as if time were
running backwards. We simply do not expect mixtures like this to
segregate of their own accord. Indeed, I indicated in Book I that the
second law of thermodynamics seems to forbid it: this law insists that
things get more disorderly and jumbled up as time progresses. What’s
more, the grains don’t just separate out—they separate into a pattern
with a characteristic size scale, namely the width of the stripes. These
stratified landslides have surely been taking place for centuries in
industry, engineering, and agriculture, as for example when mixtures
of different cereal grains or sands are poured out of a hopper. But
perhaps the layers remained hidden inside the conical heaps.
If you do the experiment, you’ll see that the stratification happens in
a characteristic manner: each landslide generates a pair of stripes,
which begin to appear first at the bottom of the slope and run back
*The mixture should be stirred, not shaken. Shaking, as we will see later, does not necessarily guarantee good mixing of different kinds of grain.

up it in a kind of kink at the sloping face. The topmost stripe of the pair
contains the larger grains. Makse and colleagues supposed that the key
to this sorting process is that the larger grains tumble down the slope
more freely than the smaller ones, which are more easily trapped in
small dips and irregularities. This same effect can be seen in rock slides,
where the largest boulders crash to the bottom of the slope while the
smaller ones get stuck further up the hillside. In effect, the slope looks
smoother to the large grains than to the small ones.
Since the large grains reach the bottom first, there is segregation of
these grains at the foot of the heap. There they pile up and create a kink in
the slope. Then, as the subsequent grains tumble down and reach the
kink, the small grains get stopped first, since the large ones are less easily
trapped there. So the small grains are deposited first, and the large ones
come to rest on top, moving the kink back up the slope as they do so.
To study this in a simple model, we need to specify some kind of
criterion for when an avalanche starts. This is a well-understood issue
for piles of grains, and you can see it for yourself by tipping up bowls of
granulated sugar and rice until an avalanche occurs. First, smooth the
surfaces of the materials so that they are both horizontal. Then slowly
tilt the bowls until a layer of grains shears off and runs down the slope.
You’ll find that there is a critical angle, called the angle of maximum
stability, at which sliding takes place. And when the avalanche has
finished, the slope of the grains in the bowl will have decreased to
a stable value (Fig. 4.14). This is called the angle of repose. However
high a pile of grains grows, recurrent landslides ensure that the slope
stays more or less constant, equal to the angle of repose. These
‘avalanche angles’ depend on the grain shape: they are bigger for rice
Fig. 4.14: A pile of grains will undergo an avalanche at a critical angle
called the angle of maximum stability, here denoted um. The avalanche
‘relaxes’ the slope to a stable angle called the angle of repose (ur). These
angles generally differ for grains of different shapes.

than for sugar, whereas granulated sugar, caster sugar and couscous (all
with roughly spherical grains) have similar angles of stability within the
accuracy of this kitchen-table demonstration.
It was quite by chance that Herna ´n Makse decided to conduct his
initial experiments with sand and sugar, which have slightly different
grain shapes and therefore slightly different angles of maximum stability and repose. Different grain sizes alone would not have produced
stratification, but only crude segregation with the larger grains gathered
at the foot of the slope. So in the model that he and his colleagues
developed, they tried crudely to mimic this difference in shape. They
considered two types of grain, square and rectangular. These drop on to
the pile and stack in columns (Fig. 4.15). This is a good example of what
‘making a model’ means in physics, because of course the grains in the
experiments are clearly not squares and rectangles, nor do they stack
up in regular vertical columns. The skill resides in deciding whether
such simplifications matter. Here, the researchers judged that they
would not wreck the model’s ability to mimic what is going on.
The heap was assigned characteristic angles of repose and maximum
stability— ur and um. When a grain drops on to the pile to create a local
slope greater than um, it tumbles down from column to column until it
findsapositioninwhichtheslopeislessthanorequalto um.Iftheslopeis
everywhere equal to um then the grain tumbles all the way to the bottom.
Thisisasignthattheslopeisprimedforalandslide.Makseandcolleagues
stipulated that if a grain rolls all the way to the foot of the pile, thenall the
grains at the slope surface tumble, starting at the bottom, until the slope
everywhere is reduced to the angle of repose ur.
This model recreates the striped landslides (Fig. 4.15e) Because the
large grains are ‘taller’ and so tend to make the slope steeper than the
small grains, they tumble more readily. This accounts for the segregation of grains, with the larger ones ending up at the bottom. Stratification, meanwhile, arises from the different grain shapes and thus the
different angles of repose and maximum stability. This simple model
doesn’t capture everything that is going on in the experiments: for
example, to get good stratification you also need to get the pouring
rate right (not too fast). That has something to do with the details of
how grains collide, which is not given much attention in the model.
Roll out the barrel
As bricklayers know, you can mix up powders inside the rotating
drum of a cement mixer. But that is generally done with water added.

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 97
If the powders are dry, perfect mixing might never happen no
matter how many times the drum turns. This became clear to Julio
Ottino and his colleagues at Northwestern University in Illinois when
they tried in this way to mix two types of salt, identical except for
being dyed different colours, starting with the powders divided into
two segments (Fig. 4.16a). If the drum rotates slowly, the layer of
granular material remains stationary until the drum tips it past its
angle of repose, whereupon the top layer slides in an avalanche
(Fig. 4.16b). This abruptly transports a wedge of grains from the top
to the bottom of the slope. The drum continues to rotate until another
wedge slides.
With each avalanche, the grains within it get scrambled (there’s no
stripey segregation here, because only the grains’ colour is different). So
the powders in each successive wedge become gradually intermixed.
But are grains also exchanged and mixed up between wedges? They are
if the drum is less than half-full, because then bits of each wedge
intersect with others (Fig. 4.16b). But when it is exactly half-full the
wedges no longer overlap (Fig. 4.16c), and mixing then occurs only
within individual wedges. If the drum is more than half-full, the outcome is striking. There is a region around the outer part of the drum
where avalanches and mixing take place, but in the central region is a
core of material that never slides (Fig. 4.16d). The initially segregated
grains in this core therefore stay segregated even after the drum has
rotated many times (Fig. 4.16e). In theory you could spin this cement
mixer for ever without disturbing the core.
Even if you start with a barrel full of well-mixed grains, they will not
necessarily stay that way when tumbled. In 1939 a researcher named
Yositisi Oyama in Japan found that grains may segregate into bands
when turned in a rotating cylindrical tube (Fig. 4.17a).* This happens if
the grains have different angles of repose—for example, tiny glass
beads will separate from sand. And this banding will happen for different-sized grains even if they have the same angle of repose, if they are
rotated in a tube with a succession of bulges (Fig. 4.17b). The larger
*The phenomenon did not become general knowledge until much later, for Oyama’s
paper seems to have left little impression until it was rediscovered in modern work on
granular materials. Julio Ottino suggests that it was an example of what the biologist
Gunther Stent called ‘scientific prematurity’: a discovery made too early to be connected
to facts and theories then known.

balls gather in the necks if the tube is more than half full, but in the
bellies if it is less than half full. In all these segregation processes it is
important that the grains only partially fill the tube, so that there is a
free surface across which grains can roll in avalanches.
Joel Stavans from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and his
coworkers have proposed that this ‘Oyama effect’ (as it deserves to be,
but has not yet become, known) might be used to separate different
kinds of grains in a mixture. They say that the banding results from the
complex interplay between two properties of the grains: their different
angles of repose and the differences in their frictional interactions with
the edge of the tube. When the researchers created a model of the
tumbling process based on these assumptions, they found it predicted
that the well-mixed state of the grains is inherently unstable, since
small, chance imbalances in the relative amounts of the two grains
are self-amplifying. A tiny excess of one grain type in one region
grows until that part of the column contains only that type exclusively.
That cannot be the whole story, however, since the segregated patches
seem to have a fairly well-defined typical size even in a tube of uniform
width (as opposed to one where the size is set by width oscillations of the
tube). Amplification of random imbalances, in contrast, would give
patches of all sizes. How, then, to account for this characteristic length
Fig. 4.17: Grains of different shapes (and thus angles of repose) will
segregate into bands when rotated inside a cylindrical tube (a). Here
the dark bands are sand, and the light bands contain glass balls. In a
tube with an undulating cross-section (b), a difference in size alone is
enough to separate the grains, which segregate into the necks and
bellies. (Photos: Joel Stavans, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot.)
100 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
scale in the pattern? Stavans and colleagues point out that this is analogous to what happens when a mixture of miscible (‘mixable’) fluids is
suddenly made immiscible (for example, by cooling them down). This
happens in rapid ‘quenching’ of a mixture of molten metals below their
freezing point: the two metals separate into blobs of more or less uniform
size. In this process, called spinodal decomposition, blobs of all sizes
grow in a self-amplifying manner, but those of a certain size are more
stable than the others and therefore get selected preferentially. By carefully controlling the conditions, such as the rate of cooling, a particular
blob size can be obtained by design; this is often done in metallurgy and
chemical engineering to make particles of specified sizes.
Self-organized avalanches
The problem with landslides and avalanches is that you can never quite
be sure when they will happen. Sometimes they are set off by unpredictable disturbances such as earthquakes—that is how most tsunamis
are generated, when seismic tremors send subsea sediments sliding
down a slope. But avalanches seem also to have an intrinsic capriciousness. For simple piles of more or less identical grains, we can feel sure
that there is trouble in store once the slope exceeds the angle of repose;
but even then it is hard to know how big the landslide will be. If the
grains are of many different sizes and shapes, or if they have complex
frictional properties (as is the case for wet soil or sticky snow crystals),
or if the surface on which they rest is rugged, we cannot be sure what to
expect. All we know is that when grains are set in motion, we had better
watch out.
Does that mean we can make no useful predictions about the timing
or the size of avalanches? Not exactly. Rather, it means that avalanche
science, like earthquake science, is necessarily statistical: we can’t say
exactly what will happen in a particular event, but we can know about
the relative probabilities of what might happen.
And in fact, studying landslides this way has proved to be astonishingly productive. For it seems that the humble pile of sand is analogous
to a great many ‘catastrophic’ processes that happen in nature, from
forest fires to ecological mass extinctions. The key feature of all these
processes is that, while they are unpredictable, they are not fully
random in the sense that each event happens independently of the
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 101
others. There is a subtle but very important statistical regularity in such
processes, and it is one that connects these seemingly disorderly, unpredictable phenomena to ones that give rise to well-defined patterns.
For it appears that landslides, like most of the patterns we have encountered already, are self-organized.
To see what that means, let’s go back to the simple conical sand pile. In
1987, physicists Per Bak, Chao Tang, and Kurt Wiesenfeld at Brookhaven
National Laboratory on Long Island, New York, devised a model to describe the way such a pile behaves as it grows by new grains being poured
on to the apex. These researchers initially had no intention of studying
piles of sand. Rather, they were investigating an aspect of the electronic
behaviour of exotic solids that is so recondite I do not even propose to
describe it. What they came to realize is that the behaviour of the electrons in these materials can be represented by the behaviour of sand
grains in a pile. That is not to say that the electrons themselves form a pile,
or anything of the kind. It is a little like the way one can model oscillating
chemical reactions by thinking of foxes eating hares, as I described in
Book I: the equations describing both behaviours look the same.
Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld then considered a pile of sand grains with a
specific angle of repose onto which new grains are steadily dropped. In
the simplest version of this model the sand pile is two-dimensional—as if,
in the experiments on striped landslides, that I described earlier, the two
glass plates are so close together that the pile is only one grain thick. What
happens as grains are added to this pile one by one at random points?
The pile builds up unevenly, so that its slope varies from place to place
(Fig. 4.18a). But if anywhere this slope exceeds the angle of repose, a
landslide is triggered which sweeps down the hillside and reduces the
slope everywhere to less than this critical value (Fig. 4.18b). How big is
the landslide? That is to say, how many grains does it set tumbling? Bak
and colleagues found that, in their simple model of a sand pile, a single
new grain added to the pile can induce a landslide of any magnitude.
It might set off just a handful of grains, or it might bring about a catastrophic sloughing of the entire pile. And there is no way of telling, no
matter how carefully we inspect the slope beforehand, which it will be.
In other words, the smallest perturbation can have an effect quite out
of proportion to its size—or it can remain just that, a small perturbation
with a small effect. There is no characteristic scale to the system: in this
case, no typical or favoured number of grains is set tumbling when one
more is added. The model sand pile is thus said to be scale-invariant.
102 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
We will see later in this book and in Book III that this is a common
characteristic of a certain class of disorderly forms and patterns: they
have no natural length scale, so that we cannot be sure whether we’re
looking at the whole system or just a small fragment of it.
Yet while landslides of all sizes (from a single grain to the whole
slope) are possible, they are not all equally probable. If we keep track
of the number of landslides of different sizes as we continue to add
grains to the slope, we will find that there are many more little slides
Fig. 4.18: The slope of a granular heap varies locally from place to
place (a). In this pile of mustard seeds, small variations in slope are
superimposed on a constant average gradient. When the slope
approaches the angle of maximum stability, the addition of a single
seed can trigger an avalanche (b). This avalanche can involve any
number of grains, from just a few to the entire surface layers of the
slope. (Photos: Sidney Nagel, University of Chicago.)
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 103
than big ones. Landslides in which the whole slope tumbles are rare
indeed. Thus, the number of landslides decreases as the number of
grains it involves increases. In the model of Bak and colleagues, this
relationship has a particular mathematical form: the frequency f (or
equivalently, the probability) of an avalanche is proportional to the
inverse of its size s (Fig. 4.19). This kind of inverse relationship between
the size of an event and the probability that it will attain that size is
commonly called a 1/f (‘one over f ’) law. Technically, it is an example of
a so-called power law. That simply implies that some quantity y is
proportional to some other quantity x raised to some power a: y !/2
xa. Here, the power (also called the exponent) a is equal to 1: f !/2
s1. I hope this maths is not too distressing—it is basically the same as
that which I introduced at the start of Book I, where I promised that it
was all you would need here. We will return to power laws again in Book
III. The key point is that a 1/f law is not what one would predict if each
of the events it is describing were each happening independently of the
next. In that case, the mathematical relationship between size and
frequency or probability is instead described by the familiar bell curve.
Avalanches can be regarded as fluctuations of the sand pile: disturbances of a steady state, corresponding here to a slope inclined at the
Fig. 4.19: In a simple model of sand-pile avalanches, the frequency
of an avalanche of a certain size decreases in inverse proportion to its
size. On a graph plotting the logarithm of frequency against the
logarithm of size, this relationship appears as a straight line with a slope
of minus 1 (shown by the dashed line). (After Bak, 1997.)
104 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
angle of repose. If we added no more grains to such a slope, it would
remain unchanging indefinitely. When we do add grains, the slope has a
continual series of convulsions (avalanches) of all sizes, all of which
rearrange the slope so that on average it rests at the angle of repose. The
constant rain of grains makes the sand pile a non-equilibrium system.
We encountered these in Book I, where I explained that they are the
sources of most natural patterns. We also saw there that, in order to
keep a system out of equilibrium, we have to provide a constant supply
of energy, and generally of matter too. That is what is happening to the
sand pile: the falling grains are perpetually injecting energy and matter
into the slope. This is what drives the fluctuations.
It turns out that 1/f laws govern the size of fluctuations observed in
a wide variety of natural and human-made systems. An electrical current flowing through a resistor undergoes tiny fluctuations of this kind,
and so does the amount of heat and light (the luminosity) emitted by
the Sun. These latter fluctuations are due to outbursts of super-hot
plasma called solar flares, which are generated by writhing magnetic
fields in the Sun’s outer atmosphere. The light from distant astrophysical
objects called quasars shows the same kind of variability; so do some
records of volcanic eruptions and of rainfall. Some palaeontologists
have argued that the geological record of mass extinctions (catastrophic
events that wipe out a significant fraction of organisms on Earth)
seem also to show a 1/f relationship between the size and frequency of
the events, at least for marine ecosystems. In all these cases, we can
see abrupt avalanche-like events happening on all size scales.
Although 1/f power laws have long been known to govern the statistical behaviour of fluctuations in diverse natural systems, the reasons
for it were unknown before Per Bak and his colleagues devised their
model of a sand pile. Here, then, was a simple instance of such behaviour, in which all the ingredients were known, that might offer some
clues about the general origin of 1/f laws.
There is something very peculiar about this model sand pile: it is
constantly seeking the least stable state. We are used to quite the
opposite: nature generally seems to crave stability, which is why water
runs downhill, golf balls drop into holes, trees topple. The sand pile,
however, is for ever returning to the state in which it is poised on the
brink of an avalanche. Each time an avalanche occurs, this precarious
balancing act gives way; but then as further grains are added, the
system creeps right back to the brink.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 105
States like this, which are susceptible to fluctuations on all scales at
the slightest provocation, have been known to physicists for a long
time. They are called critical states, and are found in systems as diverse
as magnets, liquids, and theoretical models of the Big Bang. Every
liquid adopts a critical state at a particular temperature and pressure,
called the critical point. If you heat a liquid, it evaporates to a vapour
once it reaches boiling point: the state of the fluid changes abruptly
from a (dense) liquid to a (rarefied) gas. But above the critical temperature this abrupt change of state no longer happens; instead, the fluid
passes smoothly and continuously from a dense liquid-like state to a
diffuse gas-like state as its pressure is lowered. The critical point is the
point at which there is no longer any sharp distinction between ‘liquid’
and ‘gas’, and no boiling point separating the two.
At the critical point of a fluid, its density fluctuates wildly from one
place to another (Fig. 4.20). In some patches the fluid has a liquid-like
density, in others it is gas-like, and these patches are constantly chanFig. 4.20: At the
critical point of a liquid
and a gas, the
distinction between
these two states of
matter disappears. A
critical fluid contains
variations in density on
all scales, with domains
of liquid-like fluid
coexisting with domains
of gas-like fluid. Here I
show a snapshot of such
a fluid, obtained from a
computer model of a
critical point. The dark

106 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
ging without any characteristic size or shape: they are ephemeral fluctuations. The fluid is poised right on the brink of separating out into
distinct liquid and gas regions (which is what it does at temperatures
below the critical point), but it cannot quite make up its mind to do so.
Now, if we were to decide whether each little pocket of fluid at the
critical point will be ‘liquid-like’ or ‘gas-like’ by tossing a coin, it
wouldn’t look like an actual critical state but would seem more uniformly random, lacking any big patches of one kind or the other. The
reason the density fluctuations look the way they do is that each pocket
of fluid is affected by the state of the fluid around it—these patches are
not all independent of one another.
It is extremely difficult to hold a fluid in the disorderly yet interdependent mixture of liquid-like and gas-like patches of a critical state.
It is on the brink of separating into two big regions, one liquid-like and
the other gas-like. A critical point is thus like a needle balanced on its
tip: theoretically a perfectly balanced state does exist, but it is unstable
against even the slightest nudge or breath of air. But while the theoretical sand piles of Bak and colleagues have this same critical character,
being susceptible to fluctuations (avalanches) on all length scales provoked by the smallest perturbation (the addition of a single grain, say),
they seem in contrast to be robust. That is to say, instead of constantly
seeking to escape the critical state, the sand pile seeks constantly to
return to it—like a needle that constantly wobbles but never falls. The
researchers called this phenomenon self-organized criticality, reflecting
the fact that the critical state seems to organize itself into this most
precarious of configurations.
Bak began to see signs of self-organized criticality just about everywhere he looked. In a theoretical model of forest fires, for instance, fires
can grow to any size, burning just a few trees in the immediate vicinity or
spreading catastrophically over large areas. The fires thus spare clusters
of unburned trees of all sizes as they sweep through the forest. If the
trees re-grow slowly, the forest is maintained in a self-organized critical
state by occasional fires. And it has been known for over four decades
that earthquakes follow a 1/f power law (or something very close to it),
called the Gutenberg–Richter law: earthquakes occur on all scales of
magnitude, from a shelf rattler to a city leveller, with the probability
declining as the magnitude gets larger. This smacks of self-organized
criticality, and a simple mechanical model of how geological faults slip
past one another reproduces this power-law behaviour.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 107
Per Bak believed that in self-organized criticality he had uncovered ‘a
comprehensive framework to describe the ubiquity of complexity in
Nature’—and not just in nature but in human systems too, such as the
fluctuations of economic markets and the spread of technological
innovation. There is no doubt that many of the models developed to
describe complex systems of this sort do find their way into a selforganized critical state. But verifying that the real world also behaves
that way is much harder, and many of the claimed instances of selforganized criticality, such as in mass extinctions and forest fires, remain
contentious. One of the problems is that the statistics are often ambiguous. To be sure you are seeing a particular kind of mathematical
relationship between size and frequency, and not just something that
looks a bit like it over a small range of size scales, you need a lot of
data—which you can’t always get. There may not have been enough
mass extinctions since the beginning of the world, for example, to allow
us to be sure that evolution operates in a self-organized critical state.
Another problem is that, whereas in a model you can usually be sure
exactly what all the important parameters are, and can see the effect of
changing each one independently, in reality complex systems may be
susceptible to all manner of perturbing influences, some more obvious
than others. Will a model of earthquake faulting that includes a more
realistic description of the sliding process or of the geological structure
of the Earth still show self-organized criticality?
In fact, it is even contentious whether real sand piles, the inspiration for
the original model, have self-organized critical states. You might imagine
that this, at least, ought to be a simple experiment to perform: you just
drop sand grain by grain on to a pile and observe how big an avalanche
follows from each addition. But there is no unique way to measure the
size of an avalanche, and the experiments that have been conducted so
far do not give a clear answer. For example, Sidney Nagel and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found in 1989 that real sand piles
seem always to undergo large avalanches, in which most of the top layer
of sand slides away, while other experiments in the early 1990s seemed to
generate power-law behaviour like that expected of self-organized criticality. Many researchers now think that real sand piles don’t show true selforganized criticality; but it is also possible that it is subtly disguised so
that it doesn’t show up in the measured size of avalanches.
If sand piles are not really self-organized critical states, perhaps that is
not so surprising, since real sand is not like model sand. For one thing,
the grains are not identical in size, shape or surface features, and these
108 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
microscopic details determine how readily they slide over one another.*
And the collisions of grains dissipate energy in a way that is not
accounted for in the simplest models. In 1995 Jens Feder, Kim Christensen, and their co-workers at the University of Oslo in Norway
attempted to settle the debate about whether or not grain avalanches
are examples of self-organized criticality. They added a new twist to the
tale: instead of studying sand piles, they looked at piles of rice. This was
because rice grains do not roll or slip over one another as readily as sand
grains do (just as rugby balls do not roll as well as footballs), and so they
capture more accurately the behaviour of grains assumed in the computer models that do clearly show self-organized criticality (a rare example of an experiment being adapted to fit the model rather than vice
versa). The grains tumble if they exceed the angle of repose, but moving
grains quickly stop rolling when this is no longer so. The researchers
looked at two-dimensional piles in which the rice grains were confined
to a narrow layer between two parallel glass plates (Fig. 4.21).
Fig. 4.21: A section of a rice pile confined between two glass plates. Notice how uneven the slope
is at this fine scale. (Photo: Kim Christensen, University of Oslo.)
*Per Bak’s book on self-organized criticality, boldly titled How Nature Works, contains a
photograph of an experimental sand pile built up against glass walls that unwittingly refutes
the point it is meant to illustrate: that grain avalanches are a ‘scale-free’ process with no
characteristic size scale. The slope shows clear chevron stripes of darker grains, presumably
generated by the stratification process I discussed earlier (pages 93–96). This is a reminder,
perhaps, that scientists risk overlooking things when they don’t expect to find them, even
when they are obvious in the data.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 109
Observing enough avalanches to provide trustworthy statistics was a
slow and tedious process, and took about a year. But at the end of it all,
the researchers concluded that the behaviour of these granular piles
depended on the kind of rice that they used: specifically, on whether it
was long grain or short grain. Long-grain rice with a larger ratio of
length to width seems to show true self-organized critical behaviour,
with a power-law relationship between the size of the avalanche (the
researchers actually measured how much energy each one released)
and its frequency of occurrence. But short-grain rice, which is more
nearly spherical and so more like sand, showed different behaviour:
instead of a simple power law, the relationship between size and frequency was more complicated than a 1/f law. That relationship could,
however, be easily mistaken for a power law (and thus for the signature
of self-organized criticality) if the measurements were not taken over a
wide enough range of avalanche sizes, possibly explaining why others
had previously claimed to have seen self-organized criticality in experimental sand piles.
So, while piles of grains apparently can show self-organized behaviour,
theywillnotnecessarily doso,and indeedgenerallywillnot;itdependson
(amongst other things) the shape of the grains and how their energy is
dissipated during tumbling. This both vindicates and modifies Bak’s
assertions: self-organized criticality seems to be a real phenomenon, not
just a product of computer models, but it may not be universal or even
particularly easy to observe or achieve. For the present time, sand piles
appear to be an intriguing but limited metaphor for nature’s complexity.
The rise or fall of nuts
I am not very good at using up the last of a packet of muesli. It is
dreadfully wasteful, I know, but the fact is that by the time you get to
the bottom, all the large pieces of fruit and nuts are gone and all that’s
left is a rather unappetizing residue of dry oat flakes. The big pieces
always seem to stay on top, and the small ones settle to the bottom.
This has become known to physicists as the Brazil nut effect.
The sorting of grains of different sizes in a shaken granular medium is
well known to engineers, but the reason for it is still disputed. You
might think that shaking would simply mix up grains of different
sizes, but clearly this is not so—usually, the larger grains instead rise
110 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
mysteriously to the top. Even if the packet of muesli left the factory well
mixed (which is unlikely), the Brazil nuts and banana flakes are likely to
have reached the top by the time the packets have made their way by
rumbling juggernaut to the supermarket. The British engineer John
Williams of the University of Bradford studied this effect systematically
in the 1960s. He saw a single large particle rise up through a bed of finer
powder as it was vibrated up and down. Williams suggested that the
large particle is ratcheted upwards: as all the particles jump up during a
shake, the large one leaves a void beneath it, into which smaller grains
fall (Fig. 4.22), so the small grains prevent the large one from settling
back to its original height after each shake. In 1992 the physicists Remi
Jullien and Paul Meakin observed this ratchet process in computer
simulations of the shaking process.
But there is more than this to the inexorable rise of the Brazil nut.
Sidney Nagel and his colleagues have conducted experiments in which
they shook glass beads, all the same size except for one or a few larger
ones, in a glass cylinder. Again, the big beads gradually rose to the top.
Nagel’s team tracked the motion of individual beads by dying a layer in
which many small beads surrounded a large one near the bottom of the
cylinder. The large bead rose up vertically, accompanied by the small
Fig. 4.22: How the brazil nut rises? Here there is a single large grain
within a powder of smaller grains (I have exaggerated the differences in
size, for clarity). The large grain (white) tends to accumulate an empty
space below it. When the box is shaken vertically, the large grain jumps
away from the walls of the void, allowing the smaller grains in a ring
around it (of which we can see two wedge-shaped cross-sections here, in
dark grey) to slide down into the void. So when the large grain settles
again, it comes to rest on the cone of dark grains and so has risen by a
small distance d equal roughly to the thickness of the dark layer. In this
way, the large grain gets ratcheted steadily upwards with each jump.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 111
beads immediately around it; but the dyed beads at the edges of the
layer, in contact with the container’s sides, began instead to make their
way down to the bottom of the container (Fig. 4.23). As the central
group of beads continued to rise, those that descended at the edges
reached the bottom and then began to rise up again in the centre. And
once the large bead and its surrounding small companions reached the
top, the large bead stayed there but the smaller ones made their way to
the sides of the container and began to travel downwards.
Thus, the small, dyed beads are in fact circulating: rising at the centre
and descending at the edges, just like fluid in the convection cells we
encountered in the previous chapter. The size segregation here is
merely a by-product of this convection-like motion: larger beads are
pushed up on the rising column of the cell but, once at the top, are
unable to follow the cycle further because the descending portion of the
cell is confined to a very thin layer (about the thickness of the small
beads) at the container’s edge.
So apparently, grainy materials don’t just flow but convect. In fact this
has been known for a long time; Michael Faraday seems to have seen it
Fig. 4.23: Grains in a tall column undergo convection-like circulating motion: those in the centre
rise upwards, and those at the edges crawl downwards in a narrow layer. The images shown here
were reconstructed from an actual experiment in which some glass beads were dyed so that their
movements could be tracked. An initially flat layer of dyed beads near the bottom of the column (a)
separates into downward-moving beads at the edges and rising beads at the centre (b). At the top,
the latter move outwards to the walls, and then begin to descend (d). The beads at the edges,
meanwhile, move inwards to the centre and start to rise, once they have reached the bottom (c,d). A
single large bead gets trapped at the top because it is too large to fit in the narrow downwardmoving layer around the column’s edges. This convective motion thus causes the segregation of
different sizes. (Images: Sidney Nagel, University of Chicago.)
112 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
in 1831. But what drives the flow? In normal fluids, we saw earlier that
convection is a result of buoyancy due to density differences between
layers of the fluid at different temperatures. But all the particles in
Nagel’s granular medium have the same density—they are all (with
the exception of the large bead, which doesn’t have to be there for
convective flow to occur) the same size. Nagel and colleagues worked
out that the important factor is the frictional force between the beads
and the walls of the container, which hinders the upward jumps of the
peripheral beads during each shake. In support of this idea, they found
that more slippery walls reduced the circulatory motions, while
rougher walls made them more pronounced. (As the computer simulations of Jullien and Meakin involved no walls at all, they would not
have seen these convective effects.)
‘Brazil nut’ particles do not always rise to the top of a mix of shaken
grains—sometimes the big grains sink to the bottom. This ‘reverse
Brazil-nut effect’ was predicted in 2002 by Daniel Hong at Lehigh
University in Pennsylvania and his colleagues, and was confirmed the
following year in shaken beads of metal, wood, and glass by researchers
at the University of Bayreuth. Hong’s theory suggested that, in mixtures
of two types of spherical bead, the big beads should switch from going
up to going down at particular thresholds of the size and density ratio of
the small and large beads. The German team confirmed that this theory
usually gives the right prediction, but that the behaviour also depends
on how fast and how hard the mixture of beads is shaken. Segregation
may also happen in thin layers of grains shaken horizontally, like sand
swirled in a gold-panner’s sieve: depending on the relative densities of
the beads, the larger ones can become marshalled either around the
edges or in the centre of the layer.
All of which suggests that the only way to really tell what your cereal
packet will do is to shake it and see.
Jumping beans
When Michael Faraday first shook the packet, he saw both circulatory
(convective) motion of grains and the spontaneous appearance of
heaps or ‘bunkers’ on the surface of the material. He suspected that
the air that is present in the tiny spaces between the grains plays a role
in these effects. When a layer of grains is shaken vigorously, the bottom
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 113
of the layer jumps away from the floor, creating a cavity that contains
almost no air. The abrupt difference in air pressure between the gas
amongst the grains and this almost air-free cavity pushes some grains
underneath the pile as it rises, and so creates unevenness in the layer,
leading to heaping. By performed experiments in which the pressure of
the gas permeating the granular layer is changed systematically to
investigate the effect on heaping, researchers have recently confirmed
Faraday’s mechanism.
Faraday proposed it as an explanation for the patterns seen in vibrating grains by the eighteenth-century German physicist Ernst Chladni.
Chladni found in 1787 that if fine sand is scattered over a metal plate
and the edge of the plate is bowed with a violin bow to excite an
acoustic vibration, the powder gathers into lines and spots that interweave in rather beautiful patterns (Fig. 4.24). The vibrations of the plate
depend on how they are excited: how hard, and at what frequency. Like
a kind of two-dimensional organ pipe or guitar string, the plate has
particular ‘modes’ of vibration in which whole numbers of waves fit
perfectly onto the surface. As with a guitar string, some points of the
vibrating surface will be moving upwards while other parts move downwards, and at some point in between there is a so-called node where the
surface doesn’t move at all (Fig. 4.25). On a plucked string this node is a
single point, but on a plate it can trace out a line. Chladni noted that
fine particles and coarse particles sitting on the surface behave differently: the fine ones pile up at the ‘antinodes’, where the plate has the
maximum amplitude of up-down motion, while the coarse ones gather
at nodes where there is no plate motion. Faraday suggested that, while
the big grains just jump about until they reach the points on the surface
that aren’t moving, the fine particles are pushed to the antinodes by air
currents caused by the pressure differences induced as the layer jumps
and opens up cavities. He tested this by sticking pieces of paper to the
plates to block or channel the air flow, and found that these had the
expected effect of redirecting the grains. Surprisingly, Faraday’s general
idea did not receive clear experimental support until 1998.
His theory suggests that the behaviour of a layer of vibrated grains
should depend on the air pressure above it. In the mid-1900s, Harry
Swinney and colleagues Paul Umbanhowar and Francisco Melo at the
University of Texas at Austin decided to see what happens to a shaken
layer of grains when there is no air at all, and thus no air currents. They
studied a very thin layer of tiny bronze spheres, each about the same size
114 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
as a typical sand grain, in a shallow, sealed container which was pumped
free of air and vibrated rapidly up and down. The vibration here was
uniform: rather than exciting the surface acoustically so that it is laced
with nodes and antinodes, the base is simply moved up and down as a
whole. Chladni figures trace out the shape of the acoustic waves,

Fig. 4.25: The patterns are caused by the movement of grains towards
nodes, where the vibrations of the plate create no displacement either
up or down. Some grains may instead move towards antinodes, the
regions of maximum displacement.

which serve as a patterning template. But here there is no such template:
no forces that would obviously drive the grains into specific patterns.
And yet there was pattern in abundance. In fact, this set-up has
proved to be the most fertile breeding ground for grainy patterns so
far known. The granular layer became organized into a series of dynamic ripples: stationary waves in which the grains are constantly
rising and falling in step with each other. These wave patterns can be
visualized by ‘freezing’ the little bronze balls at one point in their
motion using a stroboscope: the light flashes on and illuminates the
balls in step with their oscillatory rise and fall, and so always catches
the pattern at the same point in its cycle. Swinney and colleagues saw
patterns that might by now be familiar to us: stripes (interspersed with
dislocations), spirals, hexagonal and square cells, and more random,
non-stationary cell-like patterns that appear to be turbulent (Fig. 4.26).
The pattern depends on the frequency and amplitude of the
shaking, and switches between patterns happen abruptly as critical
thresholds are crossed. The grains move up and down at frequencies
that are simple ratios of the shaking frequency: once in every two
shakes or, for larger amplitudes of shaking, once in every four. But
different parts of the same pattern may oscillate out of step with one
another, so that one part is rising while the other is falling. Then the
strobe light catches the grains out of phase, illuminating peaks (bright)
in one region and troughs (dark) in another (Fig. 4.27). When the
amplitude of shaking exceeds a certain threshold, the patterns dissolve
into disorder: if the grains are thrown too high, they can no longer
organize all their motions in step.
Why doesn’t the layer of grains simply move up and down as a whole,
without any pattern at all? Well, it does do just that if the amplitude of
vibration is small. But above a critical amplitude there is a bifurcation
in this flat layer: a switch from a single steady state of grain motion to
two states, one in which the grains are rising and one in which they are
falling. Each of these states may exist at different points in the layer,
which becomes organized into alternating stripes that rise and fall out
of step. At low frequencies the stripes criss-cross in a square pattern.
Then, at a second critical amplitude, a second bifurcation occurs,
leading to a hexagonal pattern. At one point on the oscillatory cycle
this pattern appears as an array of little spot-like peaks, whereas if the
stroboscope is set up to capture the pattern half a cycle later one sees
an array of hexagonal honeycomb cells, with voids in the centre. Thus
116 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
the pattern reveals itself as a doubled-up oscillation: spot, void, spot,
void...You can make out both of these patterns (along with two intermediate configurations in out-of-step regions) in Fig. 4.27.
These patterns result from collisions between grains: this is what
puts the grains literally ‘in touch’ with one another, so that their movements can become synchronized. Swinney and colleagues found that
they could reproduce the patterns in a model if they assumed that the
grains lose a little energy when they collide. At the same time, of course,
they are being pushed up by the base of the container, and pulled back
down by gravity. But remarkably, we don’t even need to take that into
account to explain the patterns: it all just depends on collisions, which

including stripes, squares, and hexagons, as well as less orderly, ‘turbulent’ patterns. (Photos: Harry

RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 117
is to say, on the horizontal movements of the grains. Troy Shinbrot, then
working at Northwestern University in Illinois, has shown that this is so.
In his model the grains do not move vertically, but are simply given a little
kick in a randomly chosen horizontal direction on each vibration cycle,
reflecting the randomizing influence of shaking. This may bring a grain
into collision with one of its neighbours, whereupon they lose a little of
their energy. There seems to be nothing in this prescription but a recipe
for randomness, and yet after just a hundred shakes Shinbrot found an
initially random scattering of grains organizing themselves into stripes,
hexagons, and squares (Fig. 4.28). Which pattern is selected depends on
the strength of the randomizing effect of shaking and on the average
distance that each grain travels before colliding with another. As well as
reproducing the patterns observed experimentally, Shinbrot found others
that had not been seen before (Fig. 4.28d) but which might, he suggested,
appear if the right experimental conditions could be found.
All these patterns can be regarded as wave-like disturbances of a
uniform system: the pattern emerges much as a standing wave appears
Fig. 4.27: When different domains of the granular pattern rise
and fall out of step, the stroboscope that captures a frozen image
reveals the domains at different stages in their cycle, and so the
patterns look different, even though they are in fact identical.

in a vibrated tray of water.* But there is another way in which we can
describe them: as ranks of individual elements that interact with each
other to form ordered structures, like people arranging themselves
evenly spaced out on a crowded beach. You could regard this picture
as a kind of ‘particle-like’ alternative to the wave-like picture of global
instabilities with characteristic wavelengths. It is possible to capture
Fig. 4.28: Complex ordered and irregular patterns arise spontaneously in a simple model of a
shaken thin layer of grains as a result of the interplay between random ‘noisiness’ of the grain
movements and collisions between them. (Images: Troy Shinbrot, Northwestern University,
Evanston, Illinois.)
*This is more metaphor than analogy. A standing wave has its wavelength set by the size of
the container: the wave has to ‘fit’. But the regular patterns in vibrated grains are more
striking because the wavelength is determined by the properties of the grains themselves: by
how they collide, and how far they move between collisions. This is why these latter are truly
self-organized patterns.
RIDDLE OF THE DUNES j 119
and study these ‘pattern particles’ of shaken sand in isolation. Swinney
and colleagues found that, for a certain range of layer depths and
shaking frequencies and amplitudes, they could generate just a few
lone oscillating peaks, or even just a single one, in the granular layer
(Fig. 4.29).
They call these lone peaks oscillons: isolated ‘packets’ of oscillation.
An oscillon is a peak of jumping balls at one instant, and a crater-like
depression the next. It looks rather like the splash made when something plops into a puddle of water—except that the splash doesn’t die
out in a series of spreading ripples but keeps jumping back up as if
captured in a time loop. These beasts exist for a shaking amplitude
slightly smaller than that required for the appearance of the full pattern.
Swinney and colleagues discovered that they could conduct a curious
kind of ‘oscillon chemistry’ with them. Oscillons can move around
through the granular layers, and when they encounter one another, one
of two things can happen. Each oscillon jumps up and down at half the
shaking frequency, and so two oscillons must be either in step with
each other or perfectly out of step, one rising to a peak when the other
Fig. 4.29: Individual elements of the granular wave patterns, called
oscillons, can be isolated. Each oscillon is a single peak that rises and
falls, as seen here from above (a,b) and from the side (c,d) at different
points in the cycle. (Photos: Harry Swinney, University of Texas at

makes a crater. Two out-of-step oscillons attract each other, like particles of opposite electrical charge, enabling them to link up into ‘molecules’ (Fig. 4.30a). Whole strings of out-of-step oscillons can form,
analogous to chain-like polymer molecules (Fig. 4.30b). The range of
the attractive interaction is only small, about one and a half times the
width of an oscillon, so they have to approach quite closely before
sticking together. Oscillons that are in step, meanwhile, repel each
other, like particles with the same electrical charge. A party of in-step
oscillons will form a hexagonal pattern (Fig. 4.30c), since this allows
each oscillon to stay as far from all of its neighbours as possible. This is
like a fragment of the global hexagonal pattern in Fig. 4.26.
The world in a grain of sand
Shaking, tumbling or even simple pouring can therefore cause grains to
mix, to unmix, or to form rather wonderful patterns. I don’t imagine for
a moment that we know all there is to know about the capacity of
granular substances for generating spontaneous patterns, nor have I
been able here to survey all of those that are currently known. Because
at present there is no general ‘theory of grains’ that will tell us what to
expect, and because not even the scientists studying them have yet
acquired the necessary intuition, we cannot predict what we might see
in a given experiment.
Osborne Reynolds, the doyen of fluid dynamics whom we encountered in Chapter 2, had big visions for grainy flows. Reynolds discovered
that, in order for a collection of grains to flow, it must expand a little.
Left to settle, the grains will pack together densely, and then there is
nowhere for them to go. This seems all very reasonable, but Reynolds
deduced from it a rather extraordinary conclusion. He decided that
somehow this ‘dilatancy’ of powders could explain all the mechanical
behaviours in nature. At the turn of the century, when there was very
little understanding of the internal structure of atoms, no one could be
sure what space and matter looked like at the subatomic scale.
Reynolds decided that it was in fact filled with grains: rigid particles
that, by his estimate, were about five million-trillionths (5  1018) of a
centimetre across—much smaller than a proton. The notion of all these
submicroscopic grains rubbing up against one another conjures up
an image strikingly similar to that envisaged by Rene ´ Descartes

in the seventeenth century, who postulated a universe filled with vortices in contact. Descartes’s fluid, you might say, became Reynolds’s
powder.
His idea was rather eccentric even by the standards of Victorian
science. John Collier’s portrait of Reynolds from 1904 shows him holding a basin of ball-bearings, and in a prestigious lecture two years
earlier he revealed what he had in mind with this seemingly innocuous
collection of hard particles: ‘I have in my hand the first experimental
model universe, a soft India rubber bag filled with small shot.’ Blake’s
phrase is invoked to the point of cliche ´ in research on grainy materials,
but for Reynolds it became a reality.

Follow Your Neighbour 5
Flocks, Swarms, and Crowds
IONCE question by a nervous young man at a public lecture. Wilson won a Pulitzer prize in 1990 for a book written with fellow naturalist Bert saw the Harvard biologist E. O. Wilson asked a challenging
Ho ¨lldobler on the behaviour of ants—a definitive and weighty tome, yet
communicated with joy and passion. But honestly, the young man
exclaimed with awkward and genuine puzzlement, how could a person
spend their entire research career studying something as straightforward, as prosaic and, let’s face it, as small as ants?
Wilson is by no means famous only for his work on ants. As a leading
proponent of sociobiology, otherwise known as evolutionary psychology, he became notorious in the 1970s for his endorsement of what
some considered (wrongly) to be a rigidly deterministic view of human
nature with right-wing overtones. Nonetheless, his enthusiasm for ants
runs very deep, and the audience was perceptibly anxious at how
Wilson might receive this apparently naive dismissal. But there was
no hint of condescension or defensiveness in his answer. He simply
suggested to the young man that he scatter some sugar near an ant’s
nest on a warm day—and then sit back and watch. What will unfold, he
implied, will soon seem an appropriate subject for a life’s work.
You could say much the same about many other organisms. Sit in a
park at dusk and watch a group of swallows dive and swoop, and you
enter into a profound mystery. Watch schools of fish evading their
predators off the Great Barrier Reef, or herds of wildebeest crossing
the savannah, or even observe a culture of bacteria proliferate and
spread under a microscope, and you begin to understand that biological organization does not stop at the level of the individual organism. All these groups display motions that hint at some grand scheme,
some sense of coherence and even purpose that governs the collective
behaviour of the community.
Biologists have long appreciated the significance of group behaviour
in the animal kingdom, among which they recognize the coordination
exhibited by creatures such as ants and bees—so-called social insects—
as something special and remarkable. But only rather recently have
these collective motions been seen as something akin to flow. In the
previous chapter we saw how flow may take place among solid particles
(grains) and how this can lead to remarkable forms and patterns. Now
I want to look at what happens when those grains become animated:
when they are moved not simply by gravity, or wind, or shaking, but
under their own steam, propelled by wings, legs, fins, or wiggling
bodies. By making our ‘grains’ self-propelled, we might imagine that
their motions will degenerate into the random, chaotic disorder of a
crowd. Yet flocks and swarms show that this need not be so: even
animal crowds (including those composed of humans) may display
coherence and order.
Laws of motion
This coherence may sometimes be so pronounced that it seems miraculous. How does each bird in a flock sense what all the others are going to
do, so that they all change direction simultaneously (Fig. 5.1)? Perhaps
they don’t—maybe there is a single leader that all the others follow?
Careful observation of flocking shows that the motions are not executed
in perfect synchrony (an idea that has forced some researchers in the
past to suppose a form of thought-transference or mental communication via electromagnetic fields). Rather, changes in direction seem to
propagate rapidly through the flock like waves. The same is true of fish:
in the early 1970s, Russian ecologist D. V. Radakov identified waves of
‘excitation’ that pass like ripples through schools.
This suggests that the manoeuvres are being triggered by individuals
and copied by those around them. Yet the waves seem to pass from one
bird to the next faster than their speed of reaction permits. In 1984,
Wayne Potts of Utah State University proposed that birds watched the
wave approaching and then timed their manoeuvre to coincide with
the wave’s arrival. He compared this to the timing of high kicks by a
chorus line, although the phenomenon is probably more familiar today
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 125
from the Mexican waves conducted by football crowds. The problem is
that this places a weighty burden on the sensory capabilities of birds:
they need to be able to spot the wave from afar and then to judge
precisely when they need to move in order to synchronize their motion
withthewavefrontasitreachesthem.Andwhoaretheleaders?Studiesof
group motions have generally sought in vain to identify specific individuals who tell the others what to do. Besides, if each manoeuvre involves a
different ‘leader’, how does the group decide which of them it will be?
We now know that the collective motions of animal flocks and
swarms do not demand leaders at all. They appear to be self-organized:
the coherent group behaviour emerges from simple, purely local interactions between individuals, who have no sense of what the whole
group is doing and no ability to perform great feats of anticipation.
This understanding arose initially not through any fundamental desire
to unlock the secrets of group motion, but out of an attempt merely to
imitate such motion in a computer model. The software engineer Craig
Reynolds at the Symbolics computer company in California was accustomed to thinking about problems of computer representation and

Poskanzer.)
126 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
animation in terms of algorithms and rules rather than recondite theories of physics or biology: if you want to generate a certain kind of
behaviour on the computer, what rules must you follow? In 1986 he set
about mimicking the coordinated motion of bird flocks and fish schools
in systems of ‘particles’ that move through a simulated landscape. After
watching blackbirds flock, he decided that each bird was merely
responding to what its neighbours did. What rules would reproduce
this behaviour on the computer?
Reynolds attributed to his ‘particles’, which he called boids (a condensation of ‘bird-like droids’), three basic behaviours that governed
their ‘steering’:
1. Avoid collisions or close encounters with flockmates.
2. Align with the average direction of your neighbours.
3. Stick together: steer towards the average ‘centre of gravity’ of your
neighbours.
Which individuals are the boids’ ‘neighbours’? Reynolds assumed that
this included all boids within a specified radius, which typically extends
for just a few ‘boid-widths’. Each boid thus heeds only those nearby.
These rules seem guaranteed to ensure that the boids form groups:
the third rule acts rather like an attractive force which binds them
together. They also seem designed to make the boids line up and
execute roughly parallel motions. What they do not do is include any
explicit prescription for the kind of large-scale coordination familiar in
real flocks: one might imagine that they merely prescribe bunching into
little clusters. But when Reynolds ran simulations on the computer
according to these rules, the motion of his boids looked uncannily
like the real thing (Fig. 5.2).
Reynolds was not too bothered about whether his rules were biologically realistic: he just wanted the simulations to look right, because
the ultimate goal of his computer programme was to supply a tool for
computer animation. To that end, he happily added in other rules that
made the results look even more realistic, regardless of whether there
was any biological justification for them. And indeed they looked wonderful, which is why they have been used in several films, such as
the bat swarms in Batman Returns. But scientists became alerted to
the implications when Chris Langton, a researcher on complexity at the
Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, found out about Reynolds’s work. He
invited Reynolds to speak at a 1987 workshop on artificial life, where
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 127
boids were recognized as a classic example of ‘emergent behaviour’:
self-organization produced from local rules that dictate the interactions of individual agents.
Research on ‘artificial life’—computer simulations that generate lifelike behaviour—is sometimes criticized for itself being little more than
a sophisticated form of computer gaming, preoccupied with reproducing appearances without any concern about the fundamental reasons
for them or whether they reflect what might be happening in the real
world. All the same, Reynolds’s boid model held an important message:
collective motion does not require global vision, nor does it need

complex behavioural origins. It is enough simply to follow your
neighbour. This perspective was taken up by physicists and biologists
in the 1990s in attempts to formulate more rigorous theories of flocks
and swarms. In 1994, Tama ´s Vicsek and his student Andra ´s Cziro ´k at
Eo ¨tvo ¨s University in Budapest teamed up with researchers at Tel Aviv in
Israel to devise a theory of collective motion. While they were aware
that their model might have something to say about birds and fish, its
primary motive was to explain collective motion in a much simpler
kind of organism: bacteria, specifically colonies of Bacillus subtilis. The
Tel Aviv team, led by Eshel Ben-Jacob, had found that B. subtilis can
grow into complex patterns, some of which we will encounter in Book
III. Among these are branching tendrils, some with curling tips that
resemble a kind of plant (Fig. 5.3a). Ben-Jacob and his colleagues
inspected these under the microscope and found that the curls are
produced when the bacterial cells line up and move in arcing filaments.
Fig. 5.3: Some of the complex branching patterns formed by bacteria (a, b). The curling tendrils in
a are formed by the alignment of cells into streams, while the blobs at the ends of branches in b are
circulating vortices of cells, visible in the electron microscope (c). (Photos: a,b: Eshel Ben-Jacob and

130 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Other branching patterns were tipped with blobs of cells (Fig. 5.3b)
that, on close inspection, turned out to be rotating vortices (Fig. 5.3c).
What causes these coordinated, circulating streams of cells? We saw
in Book I that some micro-organisms, such as the bacteria E. coli and
the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, communicate with one another by releasing and sensing chemical compounds that diffuse into
the environment. They move towards larger concentrations of this
chemical signal, a type of behaviour called chemotaxis. Single-celled
organisms are by no means alone in responding to chemical signals of
this sort: higher animals do it too, guided by hormones called pheromones. The impulse does not have to be chemical: some organisms will
move towards sources of heat or light, for example. The basic principle
is that an organism moves in the direction that improves its circumstances: towards warmth, nutrients, or its fellows.
Some organisms seem to achieve this sort of directed motion by
‘deciding’ whether or not to execute a turn depending on whether or
not this makes the conditions better or worse. This kind of motion is
called klinotaxis, and is performed by some species of fish. A group can
often sense and follow changes in an environmental signal if individuals don’t simply look for that signal themselves but also respond to
what one another is doing—turning if their neighbours turn, for instance. This can help to prevent individuals from wandering off course,
and can communicate the ‘scent’to individuals who haven’t discovered
it for themselves. Collaborative klinotaxis seems to help fish schools to
migrate to warmer or cooler waters over huge distances that involve
only very gradual changes in ocean temperature.
Exactly how individuals in a group communicate with one another is
a complex matter. They might send and receive chemical signals, say, or
see directly what others are doing, or they may merely get turned
around and lined up in one another’s slipstream. Vicsek and his colleagues did not worry about the mechanisms; they simply assumed
that these kinds of interaction happen, and that, as with Reynolds’s
boids, they obey a set of simple rules. In fact, there was in this case only
a single rule: each ‘self-propelled particle’ (SPP), travelling with a constant speed, moves in the direction of the average motion of neighbours
lying within some fixed distance. There was just one other ingredient in
this SPP model: the motion of each particle also had a random element,
a sort of tendency to get disorientated. If this randomness, or ‘noise’,
is too strong, it can reduce the SPPs to a collection of randomly
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 131
jiggling particles, each ignoring the others, like the molecules of a gas
(Fig. 5.4a). If the noise is lessened, however, then the particles start to
become aligned, and when they are not too densely packed into a given
space, they form little flocks that execute collective movements in
random directions, with some tendency to form circulating gyrations
(Fig. 5.4b). If the particles are more densely crowded, and the noise is
low, these groups cohere into a collective motion of the whole group,
travelling in a single direction (Fig. 5.4c).
Is this how flocks form? One of the predictions of the SPP model is
that coherent, self-organized motion emerges spontaneously, and suddenly, once the density of the animal group exceeds a particular threshold. That is a physicist’s neat version of events: you tweak a dial and
look at the effect. It isn’t easy to find such things realized in nature. But
Jerome Buhl of the University of Sydney and his collaborators have
Fig. 5.4: Self-propelled particles interacting via local rules that produce alignment with neighbours
may show collective behaviour. If the particle motions contain too strong an element of randomness
(‘noise’), there is no coherence (a). But if the noise is reduced, the particles gather into aligned
bunches (b), or, if their density is large enough, all stream together in a single direction (c). (Images:

132 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
arranged it in the laboratory. They looked at the group behaviour of
desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria), a scourge of agriculture in Africa,
the Middle East, and Asia. Desert locusts have repeatedly devastated
crops in these vulnerable regions for centuries, bringing famine and
misery in the wake of plagues of biblical proportions. Once a swarm
forms, it is almost impossible to control. Swarms may contain tens of
billions of locusts, covering more than 1,000 square kilometres, and
may travel up to 200 km a day if the wind is favourable. Before such a
swarm of mature adults takes to the air, it is heralded by the formation
of ‘marching bands’ of wingless juvenile insects: great columns several
kilometres long. These bands arise from the aggregation of smaller
groups, which gather together and march collectively into new territories, gathering recruits. If a group fails to swell its numbers this way,
however, it will eventually disband. The vital issue, then, is how
and when a group ceases to behave as a collection of meandering
individuals and starts to display coordinated motion, signalling the
Fig. 5.4: (Continued).
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 133
onset of a swarm. Understanding this process could hold the key to
disrupting a nascent swarm before it can cohere.
In marching bands there are typically around 50 locusts on every
square metre of ground. Buhl and his colleagues wondered whether the
switch from solitary to gregarious, coherent behaviour in desert locusts
might happen at a threshold density like that seen in the SPP model. So
they studied how the behaviour of the insects changed in the laboratory
as their density increased. They placed juvenile locusts in a ring-shaped
arena and watched how their ‘marching’ changed as more and more
insects were added to the group, altering the density from around 12 to
around 295 per square metre. At low densities, the creatures wandered
at random. But once the density reached between 25 and 60 locusts per
square metre, the insects began to align themselves, tramping around
the ring-shaped arena in an orderly fashion. The direction of this
motion changed suddenly every hour or so. Above 74 locusts per square
metre, however, these direction changes ceased, at least over the eighthour observing period: there was a single, relentlessly circulating flow
Fig. 5.4: (Continued).
134 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
of locusts, like a true marching band. It looked, then, as though the SPP
model predicted just what the researchers found.
Vicsek’s group has also seen such a switch from disordered to ordered
motion in colonies of cells called keratocytes, found in human skin and
other tissues (the Hungarian group studied those of goldfish scales).
These cells are able to move across a surface—that is how they gather
together in the right places to form tissues. Vicsek and colleagues found
that as the density of cells increased, they saw a change from random
motion to collective, vortex-like motions and finally to coherent flow of
the whole group, just as seen in the SPP model (Fig. 5.5).*
*It’s not clear that mobile single cells will always show these sharp switches from random to
collective motion as they become more densely populated, however. A team of US researchers found that Bacillus subtilis bacteria seem to show only gradual changes in
motion—for example, in the average velocity of cells—as the density of a colony increased.
They suspected that here the kind of sudden changes predicted by the SPP model were
smeared out by random ‘noise’ in the system, for example because of the swirling fluid
medium or the range of different cell sizes.

their density increases. The lower images show individual cell motions deduced from video data, of
which the top images are snapshots. (Images: Tama ´ s Vicsek, Eo ¨ tvo ¨ s Lora ´ nd University, Budapest.)

Group memory
The SPP model has its limitations. For one thing, it doesn’t rule out
collisions between the ‘particles’, whereas real creatures seek to avoid
bumping into one another. Nor does the model have any ingredient for
forming groups that stay permanently together: it can generate little
swarms that form and reform, and it can make all the particles in the
box move as one, but it does not explain how a group such as a fish
school can hold together without any box to contain it.
Iain Couzin of Princeton University and his co-workers have tried to
correct these deficits, while looking at motions in three-dimensional
space rather than just two. The local rules governing the behaviour of
their particles are more complicated, but they are biologically reasonable. Each individual is surrounded by concentric, spherical zones of
interaction, which determine the creature’s behaviour when another
individual enters one of these zones (Fig. 5.6a). Very close to the
individual there is a zone of repulsion: when a neighbour enters this
zone, the creature will perform an avoidance manoeuvre to ensure they
don’t collide. Beyond this there is a zone of orientation: when other
individuals come within this zone, the creature will aim to align its
motion with the average of theirs. And beyond that is a zone of attraction: the creature will simply try to stay close to others within this zone,
without bothering about orientation. It prioritizes these rules, so that,
for example, it will forget about orientation and concentrate on collision-avoidance if there are any individuals in the zone of repulsion.
Exactly how a group of simulated creatures behaves in any particular
case depends on all the various ingredients of the model, such as how
dense the group is, how big the zones of interaction are, how fast the
creatures move, and so forth. But even though these offer countless
permutations of the model ‘settings’, there are just four different basic
types of behaviour that emerge (Fig. 5.6b–e). One is a group that holds
together but without otherwise any coherence of motion. This is like a
swarm of insects such as gnats, buzzing about at random in a dense
cloud. Then there is a group that moves hither and thither in approximate alignment, reminiscent of a bird flock or fish school. The group
might alternatively display highly regimented motion in a single direction, like a group of migrating birds. And finally, the group may circulate together in a doughnut or torus shape. This last might seem odd
and artificial, but in fact it is rather common: some fish, for example
behave this way (Fig. 5.7a). Certain species of fish have to keep moving
136 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Fig. 5.6: In the model of collective animal motion devised by Iain
Couzin and his co-workers, each individual moves in a manner that
takes into account the presence of others in three nested spherical
zones (a). The innermost zone is repulsive: the creature will aim to
avoid others that come this close. But it will orientate its motion with
the average of others inside the second zone. And it will merely try to
stay close to others within the outermost zone of attraction. Four
different types of group behaviour emerge from these rules (b–e). The
group may cluster without any orientational alignment, in a swarm (b).
Or the motions may be aligned, like a flock or school (c). Or it may all
move in a single direction (d), or circulate in a hoop (e). (After Couzin
and Krause, 2002.)
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 137
Fig. 5.7: Toroidal group motion is surprisingly common. It has been seen, for example, in fish

138 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
in order to breathe; the torus allows them to do that without actually
travelling anywhere. Moving in collective rather than individual circles
may help to conserve energy, since adjacent fish may then move inside
each other’s slipstream, reducing the frictional drag of the water. Bacteria exhibit this toroidal motion, too: this is what is happening in the
vortices of Bacillus subtilis, for example (Fig. 5.3c), and it has also been
seen in colonies of the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum
(Fig. 5.7b), where it is thought that the cohesion between cells (the
equivalent of the zone of attraction) plays a crucial role.
Switches between these states happen abruptly as the model conditions are changed, rather like the sudden switch from uncoordinated to
coherent motion in the SPP model. This is a common property of
collective modes of behaviour: it is what we find, for instance, when a
liquid freezes. Cooling water just a fraction of a degree below freezing
point transforms it all to ice: the change in conditions is tiny, but the
consequent change in the state of the molecules is marked and global.
Freezing and melting are the result of interactions between all the
constituent molecules in the material, and they are known to physicists
as examples of so-called phase transitions. The models of collective
motion in animals also seem to show phase transitions.
Couzin and colleagues found that switches between the stable
states—say, from swarm-like to flock-like motion—did not always happen at the same point for both directions of change. So two groups that
started in a swarm and a flock state might remain in those respective
states even as the conditions they experience—their group density,
say—change until they are identical. In physics this kind of persistence
of a collective state is known as hysteresis. Couzin and colleagues call it
‘collective memory’: the group behaviour depends not only on the
conditions it experiences and the rules it observes, but also on its own
history. We will encounter other examples of patterns that display this
historical contingency.
An array of collective states of motion in animal groups might have
adaptive benefits, helping the organisms to cope with a changing
environment. For one thing, such motion allows information to be
transmitted rapidly throughout the group. If a few individuals detect a
predator and take evasive action, this sets up a ripple effect that travels
quickly from neighbour to neighbour until those far away ‘feel’ the
effect of the threat even though they cannot see it for themselves. In
fact, both fish and birds do seem to become better aligned when
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 139
a predator is near: by shifting to this highly coordinated motion, they
create conditions under which disturbances can propagate like waves
through the crowd. When Couzin and colleagues added the rule that
individuals perform an avoidance manoeuvre of any predator that
comes into their range of detection, while stipulating that the predators
move towards the highest-density part of the group, they were able to
reproduce many features of the escape response of real fish schools,
such as the sudden expansion of the group around a predator, possibly
creating an empty space around it, and splitting of the group into
smaller groups (Fig. 5.8).
These apparent similarities between the model and nature are encouraging. But one of the big unanswered questions is whether the
behavioural rules of the model really do correspond to those used by
the animals. This is extremely hard to test, because it is not easy or
obvious to work backwards from the observed collective behaviour to
the rules that generate it. One study has suggested that fish respond to
the motion of only a small number of neighbours (about three) when
carrying out an escape move. But it’s not at all clear that the fish are
‘counting’ here, rather than simply reacting to all of their neighbours
within a particular distance.
A crowd of fish is no more likely to be uniform than a crowd of
people. They may differ in age, size, speed, and manoeuvrability, and
also in their intrinsic preferences and tendencies. How does this diversity affect the group behaviour? Do some individuals prefer to take up
specific positions in the flow, for example? Being at the front of a group
has its attractions: if the group finds food, you get the first bite. But
there are also obvious drawbacks: if a predator finds you, then you are
apt to become the first bite. So edge positions might be favoured by the
boldest individuals, or simply by the hungriest, who may be content to
risk greater vulnerability for the chance of greater reward. A position in
the group centre, meanwhile, is not necessarily more secure: you’re
sheltered from predators, but you’re also more hindered from escaping
if a predator comes steaming through the crowd.
Models of collective motion have shown that differences in behaviour can cause individuals to adopt particular positions even without
any ‘conscious’ choice to do so. If the rules that govern an individual’s
motion differ slightly, this can automatically move them to different
positions, often causing segregation into subgroups that share the same
rules. For example, differences in swimming speed owing to different
140 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW

predator. (Images: from Couzin and Krause, 2002.)
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 141
body sizes can sort a group of fish into large and small. A naive observer, seeing this, might think that big fish actively seek out other big fish
and so on—and in fact this is often what biologists have assumed when
they see segregation within populations. But in fact the sorting may
emerge without that kind of complex decision-making at all. All the
same, the outcome may have evolutionary benefits. Parasites that infect
fish might spread themselves more readily by altering their hosts’ behaviour, for example making fish slower or less manoeuvrable so that they
adopt positions more likely to get them eaten. Conversely, a group may
ruthlessly shed individuals that stand out from the rest when predators
are nearby, making the group less likely to draw unwelcome attention—
not because the fish are truly heartless or prejudiced against difference,
but because the local behavioural rules they follow differ for ‘normal’ and
‘odd’ individuals in a way that makes the segregation happen.
Follow the leader
These self-organizing motions seem to deny any need for leaders. But
sometimes a few individuals really do know best—for example, if they
have discovered where food is to be found. When the group’s motion
becomes collective, with each member responding to its neighbours, it
becomes much easier for privileged information of this sort to be
shared among the group for its collective benefit. Couzin and his coworkers have investigated how this allows moving groups to make
complex decisions in an efficient manner. When they adapted the
model described above so that a certain proportion of individuals all
moved in the same preferred direction, only a small fraction of such
‘informed’ members were needed to guide the whole group in that
direction. And as the group became bigger, this proportion got smaller:
the ‘accuracy’ of the group improved. Real swarms do seem to have this
ability: a swarm of honeybees can find a new nest site with only one in
20 individuals knowing the way to a good location. The key point here is
that these agents who ‘know the right way’do not actually have any way
of letting the others know they have this information—no one in the
group knows who ‘knows best’, or even if there are any informed
individuals at all. But the slight bias on the group motion imposed by
a small number of individuals who all head in the ‘good’ direction is
enough to carry the others along.
142 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
What, however, if the group contains a mixture of informed individuals with different, conflicting information? Couzin and colleagues
found that in such cases a consensus always emerges, even if the
different leadership groups are of equal size. With two groups of leaders, each of which has a different preferred direction, the consensus
direction depends on how much these choices differ. The group selects
the average of the two directions, unless these are too diametrically
opposed (more than about 1208 apart), in which case the direction of
the largest leadership group is chosen. In this last case, if the two
groups are of exactly the same size then one or other of the directions
is selected at random.
An averaging consensus might not seem ideal: by selecting the average of the two ‘leadership’directions, the group will be heading towards
neither of the leaders’ goals. But that is not necessarily a problem. If the
two targets are a long way off, averaging takes the group in the right
general direction towards them both, and as it approaches, the angle of
divergence between the two possible routes gets steadily bigger (just as
you can hold two distant objects in your vision at once, but may have to
turn your head from one to the other once you get closer). When this
divergence exceeds the critical angle of 1208, then the group chooses to
head for one target or the other.
In any event, the main conclusion is that the model shows how a
group of interacting individuals can respond to the information gathered by just a few, and can reach a collective decision about how to use
that information even without any sophisticated means of assessing
and discussing it. In this sense, animal groups seem to have a democratic capacity that we might reasonably deem somewhat enviable.
Crowd psychology
It is one thing to make models of how fish and birds move, for it seems
likely that they are governed primarily by instinct. Using a computer
model of boids or self-propelled particles constrained to follow a few
simple rules in a robotic manner seems to do not too great an injustice
to these creatures’ undoubted complexity. But might people move in
this collective, herd-like fashion, too?
That seems a bold, even an impertinent, thing to suggest. But it is
surely a whole lot less impertinent than the approaches taken in some
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 143
of the earliest work on the motions of human groups, wherein so little
intelligence was attributed to individuals that they were reduced to so
many dumb, inanimate particles: the notion was that human crowds
could be regarded as genuine fluids. The physicist James Lighthill, an
expert in fluid dynamics, proposed in the 1950s that road traffic was
rather like water flowing down a pipe, and together with Gerald Whitham at Manchester University he attempted to use hydrodynamics to
develop an understanding of the vagaries of motion on a busy highway
and how it is affected by bottlenecks and junctions. And in the 1970s an
Australian engineer named L. F. Henderson wrote about ‘crowd fluids’,
considering them as though they were collections of randomly moving
particles, like those of a gas, and charting the statistical distributions of
different walking speeds.
Figuring out how people move through space does not seem to have
been felt as a strong priority by social scientists, who have found it
rather more appealing to study how groups acquire customs and traditions, behavioural traits and ideas and fashions. But the problem of
movement is of immense importance to architects and town planners,
who need to know where to lay out walkways for maximum convenience, where to place emergency exits and how many to use, how to
avoid crushes in dense crowds, and many other mundane but very real
problems linked to the way we use space.
Motivated by the sociological notion of ‘social forces’ that govern
behaviour, Dirk Helbing and Pe ´ter Molna ´r of the University of Stuttgart
developed a model of pedestrian motion in the mid-1990s that posited
the operation of forces of attraction and repulsion between individuals.
They didn’t mean to imply that these interactions exist in the same
sense as they do between magnets or electrically charged plates. What
they meant was that we tend to act in a crowd as though such forces
exist. In particular, we avoid collisions, as if a repulsive force holds us
back from bumping into each other. Two people walking towards each
other will veer aside as they approach (and if you think we are smarter
than particles, bear in mind that particles never make the same choice
as one another and so end up colliding anyway).
What else controls our movements around open spaces? In general,
we are trying to go somewhere: we have a particular destination in
mind, and will move towards it along something like the shortest
path. (Really the shortest? No, not necessarily. In a dense crowd we
cannot know what the shortest collision-avoiding path will be; and in
144 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
other situations our steps might be diverted by other factors, as we will
see.) We each have our own preferred walking speed, and will speed up
until we attain this, unless something prevents us from doing so.
These were the simple ingredients of Helbing and Molna ´r’s model.
You can see that it assumes rather uncomplicated, single-minded pedestrians. On a crowded day in the shopping precinct, that is perhaps not
a bad description of what we are. What sort of crowd motion, then, do
these rules produce? Helbing has applied the model to a wide range of
situations: negotiating busy intersections, for example, or passing
through unmarked doorways. One of the simplest situations places
the walkers in a corridor, travelling in both directions. (The corridor
could as easily be a pavement.) If the crowd density is high, there is
apparently a recipe here for chaos and congestion. What emerges,
however, is a surprising degree of order (Fig. 5.9a).
The pedestrians arrange themselves into counter-flowing streams,
trailing in each other’s footsteps. This might not seem surprising at all,
for obviously it makes sense to follow the person in front of you: that
way, you are far less likely to collide with someone coming the other
way. But there is no rule to that effect in the model prescription—
nothing to generate ‘following’ behaviour. This simply appears once
the rules are enacted. Of course, it is possible, indeed likely, that we do
show an active tendency to follow one another and form streams—if
such an impulse is included in the pedestrian model, then the bands
form more quickly, and in fact are evident even before two counterflowing groups meet. But the point is that this ingredient is not essential
for streaming to occur: it emerges from the propensity for collisionavoidance. There is ample evidence that streaming really does occur,
and you have no doubt seen it for yourself (Fig. 5.9b).
Fig. 5.9: Computer simulations of pedestrians moving in opposite
directions down a corridor show that they organize themselves into
counterflowing streams, even though there is no explicit prescription for
this in the ‘rules’ of the model (a). Such behaviour is commonly seen in
real life (b). (Photo b: Michael Schreckenberg, University of Duisburg.)

146 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Ant motorways
This sort of ‘lane formation’ among walkers is not unique to humans. It
is strikingly exhibited by army ants (Eciton burchelli), voracious carnivores that carry out truly terrifying raids on their arthropod prey. Bands
of several hundred thousand individuals may form trails many metres
wide and over 100 m long leading from their colony to the prey. The
raid has to be finished by dusk, since the ants are inactive at night, and
so they have no time to lose. The trails are divided into lanes that are
used selectively by individuals setting out from the colony or returning
back carrying their prey (Fig. 5.10).
Ants certainly may follow where others have gone before. This is one
of the key aspects of their foraging behaviour: each ant marks its path by
laying down a pheromone, and other ants are drawn towards this
chemical trail. They seek out the highest pheromone concentration,
which tends to keep them travelling along a previously marked path
rather than wandering off on their own. Thus, trails become selfreinforcing: the more ants that travel that way, the more strongly the
route is chemically marked, and so the more likely others are to use it.
This reinforcement ensures that prey are located efficiently: once a few
successful individuals have found the way there, their pheromone
footsteps will guide others. If, on the other hand, a small group of ants
gets separated from the nest and so loses its return path, it may mill
around aimlessly in a circle, each following the other and not realizing
that the path leads nowhere (Fig. 5.11).
This trail-following behaviour gives rise to characteristic branching
patterns in army-ant raids (Fig. 5.12a), which can be mimicked by
computer models that include the self-amplifying mechanism of
pheromone release (Fig. 5.12b). How, though, do the trails get divided
into lanes designated for advancing and returning workers (Fig. 5.10)?
Iain Couzin and his colleague Nigel Franks at Bristol University think
that the answer lies in the ants’ wish to avoid collisions, particularly
with those coming in the other direction.
Army ants do not have good vision (they are in fact almost blind), but
they can literally feel the presence of others that come into physical
contact. They also have antennae that extend their tactile field in front
of them. Couzin and Franks assumed that if other ants come within this
field, an ant will change direction, veering off its initial course. When
not manoeuvring out of the paths of others, the ants seek out and follow
a pheromone trail, moving to where the concentration is highest.
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 147
There are two other rules governing their motion. First, the ants know
whether they are setting out from the nest or returning to it. Real army
ants do seem to know this too, although it is not clear how—if they are
made to perform a U-turn along their route, they will quickly turn again
to resume their original direction. Second, the researchers made outgoing and incoming ants different in just one crucial way: the former
Fig. 5.10: Three-lane traffic in army ants, Eciton burchelli. The paths
of five outgoing ants are shown in black, and those of a single
returning ant in grey. The former use two ‘outside’ lanes, while the
latter stays to the centre. (After Couzin and Franks, 2002.)
Fig. 5.11: Army ants will march relentlessly in circles if a circular obstacle is placed in their midst.
They are simply following each other’s pheromone trail, unaware that it leads nowhere. (Photo:

148 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
had a greater propensity to change course when they came into contact
with others. It is not clear whether real army ants behave this way, but it
makes sense: ants laden with prey are less manoeuvrable and so less
likely to change direction.
When the model was run with a single, straight pheromone trail laid
down to guide the ants, they became segregated into three lanes, with
the inbound ants at the centre and the outgoing ones on either side.
This is precisely the arrangement found in nature (Fig. 5.10); it is also

150 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
seen in foraging termites. Again, there is nothing in the rules to ‘tell’ an
ant whether to use the inner or outer lanes—this emerges spontaneously from their interactions with one another. And once more, lane
formation makes good sense, because it means that the paths of all the
ants are less likely to be disrupted by collisions. But the ants don’t need
some instinct that tells them ‘when leaving the nest, keep to the outside
lanes’. That will happen automatically if they merely have a different
manoeuvrability when coming and going.
Aren’t three lanes a little excessive, though? Surely two would do just
as well for collision-avoidance; they work well on our roads. But the
problem with two lanes is that the pattern is asymmetrical. Do outgoing
ants stay to the right or the left? There’s nothing to tell them which,
unless the ants have some inbuilt mechanism to tell their right from
their left. With three lanes, that problematic choice doesn’t arise.
Not all ants that forage in trails form lanes like this. The leaf-cutter
ants (Atta cephalotes) just push past each other. Why is that good
enough for them and not for army ants? Perhaps part of the answer
lies in the fact that they are in less of a hurry—they do not need to stop
work at dusk, and so the selective pressure for efficiency is weaker. All
the same, collisions surely make the task of gathering food less efficient
than it might be. This, however, may not matter very much. Leafcutters carry huge burdens, and so the additional slowing they might
experience from the lack of lanes may make little difference to their
travel time—not enough, at least, to have made it worth their while
acquiring the instincts that lead to lane formation. Some researchers
have even suggested that collisions might not be all bad: they can, for
example, help to transfer information between ants—the equivalent of
a hiker coming in the other direction telling you that the cliff path
ahead has collapsed.
Outside perfume advertisements, humans do not seem to follow
each other’s chemical trails. But there are other reasons why we tread
in each other’s footsteps. In deep snow we might literally do that,
because it requires less effort and reduces the chances of plunging
down a hidden hole. Another situation in which this trail-following
may occur is on open grassy spaces. The ground may be smoother,
for instance, where others have worn the grass away. And there is surely
also a psychological impulse to ‘stick to the path’, even if we can see that
that path has been defined by other walkers rather than stipulated by
the planners. In this way, spontaneous paths are created and reinforced
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 151
across the grass (Fig. 5.13a). If old paths are abandoned for some
reason, the grass eventually grows back and covers them. This is entirely analogous to the way an ant pheromone trail gradually disperses
and vanishes if not reinforced by others.
Dirk Helbing, Pe ´ter Molna ´r, and their colleague Joachim Keltsch in
Tu ¨bingen wondered whether the pedestrian model might account for
human trails of this sort. They introduced into the pedestrian model a
tendency for walkers to walk where a trail has been worn down, this being
itself determined by how many others had walked along that route. The
Fig. 5.13: People walking over open grassy spaces wear down trails that have an ‘organic’ quality
to them, with curving paths and smooth intersections (a). Here is one such, at Stuttgart University. In
a computer model of trail-following pedestrian behaviour, similar trail patterns emerge over time
(b, c). At first, the trails between entry and exit points (at the corners here) are linear and direct (b).
But these evolve into curved trails that represent a compromise between directness and the tendency
to follow in others’ footsteps (c). (Photo and images: Dirk Helbing, Technical University of Dresden.)
152 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
path taken by a walker over an open space is therefore a compromise
between this trail-following behaviour and the wish to take the most
direct route. Unused trails became covered over at a steady rate.
The researchers found that at first walkers simply took straight-line
routes between destinations (Fig. 5.13b). But, over time, the shapes of
the trails altered: the straight lines disappeared, and instead curved
routes emerged, with islands of grass isolated in the middle of intersections (Fig. 5.13c). These routes look less geometric and more ‘organic’; but they are also less direct. They represent what the walkers
‘perceive’ to be the best trade-off between directness and ease of walking. Real human trail systems seem to show the same characteristics
(Fig. 5.13a). When the trails are all essentially going from one end of a
space to the other, these spontaneous trails may fork and branch,
sometimes creating routes that peter out (Fig. 5.14). These resemble
the foraging trails made by hoofed animals through tall undergrowth
(Fig. 5.14c).
Heavy traffic
It doesn’t take much imagination to see that Helbing’s pedestrian
model may have something to say about the flow of road traffic. On
the road we are even more constrained in our choices, so there is even
less room for free will to disrupt predictable, robotic behaviour. Road
traffic is forced to move in a line along a pre-defined path, often in
single file, and with an incentive to avoid collisions, motivated by
strong concerns for our well-being and our bank balance. All we can
really do is accelerate to our preferred cruising speed if we can, but slow
down when there is a vehicle in our lane ahead.
Helbing and others have adapted the pedestrian model to this situation. You might expect that, with such a simple set of rules, the
resulting behaviour would be also rather mundane. But these models
generate traffic conditions every bit as rich, complex, and frustrating as
those we experience daily behind the wheel. Again, the flow patterns
show clear signs of being dominated by collective behaviour. For example, it seems reasonable to suspect that, as the traffic on a straight,
one-lane road gets steadily denser, it will become progressively more
congested and the average driving speed will gradually decrease until
eventually a jam forms. But that is not what happens. Instead, there are

which resemble those

154 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
rather abrupt switches between steady flow and almost immobile jams,
once a critical threshold in traffic density (the number of vehicles per
km of road, say) is exceeded. This is again analogous to a phase transition: a marked shift in ‘global’ behaviour brought about by only a
small change in conditions. It is literally as though the traffic ‘freezes’,
changing from liquid-like flow to solid-like stasis.
This sudden triggering of a jam is seen in a traffic model devised by
Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg, working in Germany in the early
1990s, which has more or less the rules indicated above.* Here a series
of cars drives in procession down a straight road, all of them attaining

of each vehicle, to account for the fact that no one (whatever they might like to think) drives

the same speed if the road ahead is sufficiently clear. This means that
on a graph of distance travelled plotted against time, each car’s trajectory traces out a straight, sloping line when it moves unimpeded
(Fig. 5.15a). But if a car is forced to slow down, the line kinks towards
the horizontal, since then the vehicle covers a shorter distance in the
same time interval. When a single car is programmed to brake suddenly
before speeding up again—mimicking, say, a driver whose attention
wanders momentarily—the consequences are dramatic. This action
forces the drivers immediately behind to brake as well, creating a little
knot of congestion. This does not simply dissipate once the errant
driver speeds up again, because the congestion makes others brake
further upstream too, setting up a wave of congestion that propagates
Fig. 5.14: (Continued).
156 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Fig. 5.15: Phantom jams in road traffic are a consequence of
collective behaviour. The motion of a car moving down a road at a
constant speed can be represented on a graph of distance travelled
against time as a sloping straight line (a). In a computer model of many
such cars moving in procession along a motorway, a single small
disturbance caused by one vehicle slowing abruptly and briefly can
develop into a complex jam (b, dark bands), which moves upstream
and splits into several ‘waves’ of congestion. Observations of real road
traffic have shown effects like this (c). (Images b and c: from Wolf,
1999.)
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 157
steadily in the opposite direction to the traffic flow (Fig. 5.15b). And as
time passes, things go from bad to worse. This little jam keeps moving
upstream, but it also gets wider and eventually forks in two, creating
two knots of congestion. This branching continues, creating a whole
series of jams without any apparent ‘cause’. A driver entering the scene
long after this initial disturbance encounters waves of ‘stop-and-go’
traffic: a flow pattern that has acquired a momentum of its own.
Something like this has been observed in real road traffic (Fig. 5.15c).
But here it doesn’t look quite as bad as in the model, and indeed it turns
out that the basic model of Nagel and Schreckenberg, while capturing
the essential collectivity of drivers’ behaviour, is a little too over-sensitive to minor disturbances. Boris Kerner and Hubert Rehborn of the
Daimler-Benz research labs in Stuttgart think that congested traffic in
fact has two states: a dense, almost immobile jam and a slightly less
dense ‘synchronized’ state in which the traffic keeps flowing steadily at
a moderate speed that is identical for all cars. Others maintain that the
switch from free to synchronized flow has to be triggered by an external
Fig. 5.15: (Continued).
158 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
disturbance, such as a bottleneck on the road or a junction where
another traffic stream joins.
Such disturbances are of course common on real roads, and may be
responsible for much of the variation and complexity of real traffic.
Dirk Helbing and his colleagues found that an entry junction onto a
motorway, for example, can induce all kinds of traffic jams, from knots
that move upstream or stay pinned to a point on the road, to oscillatory
waves of congestion or solid block-like jams.
These models show that traffic flow has its own characteristic and
robust patterns in time and space that emerge spontaneously and
suddenly from the interaction of many individuals. This can make
jams seem like a rather fundamental and inevitable part of life on the
road; but the message need not be so gloomy. By helping us to understand under what conditions congestion and jams form, traffic models
may enable us to lessen the chances of their happening, for example by
appropriate design of road layouts, of speed restrictions, or of lanechanging rules. This might not only make the roads more pleasant, but
could also make them safer, while reducing pollution. And models that
can predict traffic flow on a real road network, based on measurements
of traffic at a few key locations, could be valuable for planning a route
or for alerting road authorities to potential congestion problems before
they arise. Schemes like this, using models such as those I have described, are already being implemented in European and American
cities and urban areas to allow real-time prediction of road use.
Don’t panic
The simulated crowds studied by Helbing and his colleagues are generally rather well-behaved, finding collective modes of movement that
ease the flow and enable people to move past each other with the
minimum of jostling and discomfort. When two such crowds converge
at a doorway and try to pass through from opposite directions, they
even display what looks like good manners, standing back from time to
time for walkers coming the other way. (Of course, these ‘manners’ are
illusory, since the simulated walkers have no scruples; their apparent
thoughtfulness is prompted merely by the rule that avoids collisions.)
But not all crowds are so civilized. In crowd disasters, panic can lead
people to push others over and trample them. Riots, building fires, and
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 159
crushes at sports stadiums, rock concerts, and other public gatherings
have in the past claimed many lives as a result of the uncontrolled
movements of crowds that, in their terror or excitement, have ceased to
show anything like the ‘wisdom’ with which they are fashionably attributed.
In 1999 Helbing teamed up with Tama ´s Vicsek and his colleague Ille ´s
Farkas in Budapest to try to understand what happens when a crowd
panics. They studied how the ‘model pedestrians’ move when they want
to get somewhere so quickly that the desire for speed overwhelms the
impulse not to come into contact. The researchers found that a crowd
like this can become jammed if all the individuals try to pass through a
single doorway in a simulation of ‘escape panic’. As walkers press in
against one another in the dense throng in front of the door, they can
become locked into arch-shaped lines, unable to move forward. It is
precisely this sort of jamming that gives masonry arches their stability:
the stones push against their neighbours to form a robust structure,
held together by friction, which resists the tug of gravity. Such arches
are also known to appear in grainy materials as they drop through a
hole, which is why salt can get stuck in the salt cellar even though each
of the individual grains is small enough to pass through the hole. Here,
then, the ‘crowd fluid’ starts to act more like a ‘crowd powder’. The
result is counterintuitive in a rather chilling way: as everyone tries to
move faster, the crowd actually exits through a doorway more slowly
than it would if the individuals kept to a more moderate pace. The
pressures that build up in the jammed crowd can be frightening: in real
crowd disasters they have been large enough to bend steel bars and
knock over walls.
Real animals do seem to behave this way. It is not the kind of
experiment one can conduct ethically with human subjects, of course,
and one winces even to think of it being done with mice. But Caesar
Saloma and colleagues at the University of the Philippines, who did this
in 2003, apparently caused no lasting harm to their subjects, which had
to escape from a chamber that was being slowly flooded. They found
that the mice showed just the kind of ‘escape panic’ exhibited by the
computer model, and that the flow through the exit had the predicted
feature of occurring in bursts of different sizes—very much like, in fact,
the self-organized avalanches of the sand-pile model I described in the
previous chapter.
160 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
Because of his work on pedestrian motion and particularly on crowd
panic, Dirk Helbing was consulted in 2006 about crowd control for the
annual pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. This event,
called the Hajj, draws up to four million pilgrims, and the threat of
crowd disaster has been ever present. Hundreds of lives have been lost
in the past—in 1990 over 1,000 people were killed in a stampede in a
pedestrian tunnel leading out from Mecca to the nearby town of Mina,
where a ritual stoning takes place.
This stoning has been a flashpoint for several crowd disasters. The
pilgrims gather in Mina to cast stones at pillars called the jamarat, reenacting the stoning of the devil by Abraham. To ease congestion, the
three pillars have been replaced by elongated, elliptical structures more
like walls, and a two-tiered ‘bridge’ has been built so that more pilgrims
can gain access to the jamarat at the same time. But these measures
have proved inadequate: pilgrims were trampled to death during
the ritual on six occasions since 1994. The disaster in January 2006
was one of the worst: over 300 pilgrims died, and many more were
injured. The Saudi authorities organizing the Hajj realized that something had to be done. Could Helbing’s crowd model help?
For the 2006 event, the authorities had installed video cameras to
monitor the movements of the crowd. They allowed Helbing and his
colleagues to study the footage, hoping that this might reveal how the
crush became fatal. What the researchers saw surprised and shocked
them.
As the crowds on the Jamarat Bridge became denser, the steady flow
changed to stop-and-go waves like those in heavy traffic (Fig. 5.16a)—
something that had not been so clearly seen before in crowd motion.
But then, as the throng thickened still further, this motion, which was
uncomfortable and frustrating but nonetheless relatively orderly, gave
way to another kind. People became clustered into knots, reminiscent
of the eddies of fluid flow, which swirled around in all directions
(Fig. 5.16b). Pilgrims were pushed here and there, powerless to do
anything about it, with enough force to knock people off their feet. If
they stumbled, they might have no chance to get up again, nor could
their neighbours avoid trampling on them. The movement looked
startlingly like turbulence in a rushing liquid.
This ‘crowd turbulence’ is not predicted by the simple models of
pedestrian motion or crowd panic. Helbing and his colleagues think
that it is triggered when individuals alter their behaviour in response to
FOLLOW YOUR NEIGHBOUR j 161

various modes of motion, including stop-and-go-waves (a) and crowd ‘turbulence’ (b). Both images
were made by averaging the video frames over about 1–2 seconds, so that stationary people appear
sharp while moving ones are blurred. The stop-and-go waves in a propagate from left to right, while
the crowd is moving from right to left. This image was taken on a street leading to the Jamarat
Plaza. Crowd turbulence (b) is characterized by waves (clusters of walkers) moving in all directions.

162 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
the crush: instead of being passively pushed along by the crowd, people
try to ease the squeezing they experience by pushing back. The ‘crowd
fluid’ becomes animated, spontaneously injecting more energy into the
motion. That is something a simple fluid cannot do, and so it is no
surprise that ‘crowd turbulence’ doesn’t exactly mirror ordinary
turbulence. It does mean, however, that the situation suddenly becomes much more violent and dangerous.
The researchers deduced that the onset of this hazardous ‘turbulence’ has a special signature that can be spotted in video recordings.
It happens at a threshold determined not by crowd density alone but
also by how much variation there is in the speed of individuals’ motions. Together, these two factors define a critical ‘crowd pressure’ at
which turbulence sets in. So real-time monitoring and analysis of video
data on dense crowds can give advance warning of when this highly
dangerous state is about to develop, potentially allowing stewards to
introduce crowd-control measures (such as opening up new exits or
stopping further influx) that might relieve the pressure and avoid a fatal
incident.
That, however, happily did not become necessary in the 2007 Hajj. As
a result of the studies by Helbing’s team, a new route between the
pilgrim camp and the jamarah at Mina was devised, with specific
streets designated for one-way flows and stringent schedules arranged
to limit and distribute the flow of pilgrims. Despite the fact that even
more pilgrims came to the Hajj than were expected, the plan proved a
complete success, and the rituals passed without incident. There could
hardly be a better testament to the value of understanding the patterns
of the crowd.

The Trouble with Turbulence
W HAT senberg allegedly had this in mind: ‘When I meet God, I am going to ask him two questions: why relativity? And why would you ask God? The German physicist Werner Heiturbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.’
The quote is apparently apocryphal, although not implausible: turbulence was the topic of Heisenberg’s doctoral thesis in 1923. But, like
most such stories, it was coined to make a point: understanding turbulent fluid flow is so hard that neither Heisenberg nor, perhaps, God
could achieve it. Heisenberg’s name might have become linked to the
tale simply because he was better known than Sir Horace Lamb, a
British mathematician and an expert on fluid mechanics, who does
seem to have said something similar in 1932 in an address to the British
Association for the Advancement of Science.*
Whether it is genuine or not, Heisenberg’s remark is illuminating,
because it illustrates different ways in which a scientific problem can be
perplexing. One is that the phenomena themselves lie outside our
mundane experience. The theory of relativity developed by Albert Einstein might, at least from the perspective of the 1930s, be deemed a
piece of deistic obfuscation because it is well hidden in our everyday
world and therefore seems rather superfluous. It is not immediately
clear why any deity would feel the need to build a universe governed by
anything other than the old Newtonian laws of mechanics. Why dictate
that these must give way to strange relativistic effects such as the
shrinking of space and the stretching of time when objects move very
fast? The maths needed to comprehend relativity is hard, but not
*Lamb’s comment was reportedly ‘I am an old man now, and when I die and go to
heaven there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the former I am rather
optimistic.’
burdensomely so by the standards of theoretical physics. Yet the concepts involved defy our experience and intuitions.*
Other problems in science may be difficult because they really do
demand a degree of mathematical abstraction and sophistication that
is not accessible to most of us. Superstring theory is somewhat like this:
most of us can see that a lifetime would not be enough to decode its
equations.
But turbulence is difficult and perplexing in yet another way. The
basic question is simple: how do we describe a fast-flowing fluid in
mathematical terms? When flow is vigorous enough, the regular structures and patterns that we have seen in earlier chapters tend to dissolve,
leaving an apparent chaos that changes with every passing moment
(Fig. 6.1). And yet this does not destroy all structure, for then the liquid
would be pervaded by random motion throughout, so that on average
the flow is merely uniform. We do see patterns in turbulent flow, as Jean
Fig. 6.1: In turbulent flow, the motion of the fluid is chaotic, and yet some coherent structures such
as vortices survive. (Photo: Katepalli Sreenivasan, Yale University.)
*I do not mean to imply that a Newtonian universe would ‘work’; we simply don’t know if it
would or not. Of course, in reality relativity does not supplant Newton’s laws but explains
them as a special case that applies at slow speeds and in moderate gravity. But Heisenberg
was understandably puzzled about why there should be any such distinctions. Many
physicists hope that one day a unified theory will show why relativity is an essential aspect
of the way things are.
INTO THE MAELSTROM j 165
Leray surely appreciated in the early twentieth century while gazing at
the eddies of the Seine. Swirling vortices are continuously born and
swallowed up, offering tantalizing hints of order. But how do we capture
and describe that order?
It is not that we don’t know how to build a theory—the principles
governing the flow are actually remarkably straightforward. We simply
apply Newton’s laws of motion throughout the fluid, which describe
how the fluid’s velocity changes in proportion to the forces that act on
it. The problem is that we can’t solve these equations. They are too
complicated, because the fluid motion is now totally interdependent:
the movement of each little ‘piece’ of fluid depends strongly on that of
all the surrounding pieces. In a sense, this is always true in a fluid; but
when it becomes turbulent, it is no longer possible to make approximations or to take averages. Every detail matters. So the problem is
difficult not because we don’t know what the ingredients are, but
because those ingredients are too mixed up to make sense of them.
There is just too much going on.
Many of the greatest scientists have bloodied their knuckles against
the implacable walls that surround the problem of turbulent fluid flow.
David Ruelle, a physicist who has contributed a great deal to our
understanding of it, has called turbulence ‘the graveyard of theories’.
He notes with glee how the classic book Fluid Mechanics by the Russian
physicists Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, which generally displays the
characteristically uncompromising attitude to mathematical exposition common in the Russian literature, reverts to pure narrative description when the authors come to talk about turbulence. The
equations no longer help. These formidable scientists were instead
forced to do what Chinese artists have long done: to use pictures.
This is, however, perhaps to paint too bleak a portrait of where our
understanding of the patterns of turbulent flow has reached today. We
do know a great deal about these patterns, and we can say some
important things about the recondite ‘geometry’ of turbulence. This is
what I hope to give you a flavour of now.
The master equation
Isaac Newton’s Principia provides a prescription for how bodies move:
they change their velocity (that is, they accelerate) when a force acts on
166 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
them. The rate of change of velocity is equal to the force divided by the
object’s mass: this is Newton’s celebrated second law of motion. In the
middle of the nineteenth century an Irish mathematical physicist
named George Gabriel Stokes wrote down an equation for fluid motion
based on Newton’s second law. This equation was really just a more
rigorous restatement of a formula derived by the French engineer
Claude-Louis Navier in 1821, and so it bears the name of the Navier–
Stokes equation. It says that the rate of change of velocity at all points in
a fluid is proportional to the sum of the forces that promote its movement, such as pressure and gravity, along with the retarding force of
viscous drag exerted by the surrounding fluid. The Navier–Stokes equation is actually a little set of equations which, in addition to specifying
the condition of Newton’s second law, enforce the requirement that
mass and energy be conserved (nothing gets lost) as the flow proceeds.
The catch, as I say, is that the Navier–Stokes equations are often
exceedingly difficult to solve without making assumptions and approximations about the behaviour of the fluid. In effect, solving the equations requires that you already know the answer—for you can only
calculate the viscous drag on a ‘parcel’ of fluid if you know what all
the surrounding parcels are doing, and yet the same problem applies to
those too. Much of the theoretical work on fluid dynamics today
revolves around the issue of how to introduce appropriate simplifications into the Navier–Stokes equations for particular types of flow so
that they can be solved without in the process losing the essential
features.
Lord Rayleigh did precisely this when he developed a theory of
convective flow in the early twentieth century (see page 52). We saw
earlier that he showed how convection patterns (ordered arrays of
‘cells’ with circulating flows) arise above a particular threshold in the
strength of the driving force, namely the temperature difference between the cool top and hot bottom of the layer of fluid. If this forcing is
very strong, convection becomes turbulent. The switch from regular
patterned flow to turbulence is not gradual, but rather abrupt. Yet as we
saw on the surface of the Sun, the onset of turbulence does not mean
that the flow loses all structure; it’s just that the structure changes over
time in unpredictable ways.
Osborne Reynolds found the same thing for fluid flow along a cylindrical pipe. In 1883, he showed that there is a transition from smooth,
eddy-free (so-called laminar) flow to turbulent flow down pipes as the
INTO THE MAELSTROM j 167
flow rate (quantified by the Reynolds number) increases. Reynolds also
sought to understand this switch using the Navier–Stokes equations.
The equations in this case cannot be solved with pen and paper, but
they can be solved numerically on a computer: the patterns of fluid
flow that satisfy the equations are found by a series of iterations that
refine some rough initial guess. This reveals an odd thing, however. The
computer calculations do not seem to show a turbulent threshold at all;
instead, the flow may remain laminar for all Reynolds numbers.
And yet, in practice, most pipe flows with a Reynolds number above
about 2,000 are turbulent. This is a typical value for water running from
a tap, which does indeed come out as a turbulent jet (Fig. 6.2). Why is
there this discrepancy between theory and experiment? It seems that
the transition to turbulence depends on the flow being disturbed: there
has to be a ‘kick’ to trigger the appearance of eddies. In experiments in
which the flow down a pipe is carefully controlled to avoid such disturbances, laminar flow seems to persist at least up to Reynolds numbers of about 100,000. The bigger the Reynolds number (the faster the
flow), the smaller the kick required—the flow is more delicately poised
to become unstable, as we might expect.
To further complicate matters, turbulence in pipe flow does not last
for ever. If triggered by some disturbance, the turbulence seems to
persist only for a certain time before the flow becomes smooth (laminar) again. Equivalently, turbulence caused by a persistent perturbation at one point in the pipe (a bump in the wall, say) will wash out
eventually further down the pipe, if it is long enough. This settling
might take a very long time, however. It is estimated that you would
need to wait five years for the flow to travel 40,000 km along a garden
hose before turbulence excited in one segment decays again.
So even if we can solve the Navier–Stokes equations by the brute
force of computer number-crunching, such equations may not tell us
all we need to know, because they don’t take into account how the flow
might respond to the kind of perturbation that, in the real world, it is
very likely to encounter. The question is whether or not the resulting
disturbance of the flow will gradually die away, and if so, how quickly.
That is an important distinction, because the difference between
smooth and turbulent flow can be crucial in an industrial context. In
turbulent flow, the fluid becomes strongly mixed up. And turbulence in
pipe flow can hinder the passage of the fluid: the eddies, you might say,
get in the way, reducing the overall flow rate. This may cause pressure
168 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
surges in the pipe, which matters a great deal if we’re talking about oil,
gas or water flowing down service pipes, or chemical liquids being
carried between vats and tanks in a chemical processing plant. The
issue might be even more vital, so to speak, in the case of blood flowing
through the pipelines of the body’s circulatory system—a topic I consider in Book III.

Canned rolls
The question of how smooth and ordered flows capitulate to turbulence has therefore been studied a great deal. Pipe flow and convection
provide two convenient experimental settings for these studies, but
there is a third that offers another attractive demonstration of how
fluid flow tends to progress through a series of regular patterned states
before arriving at turbulence. In 1888 the French fluid dynamicist
Maurice Couette looked at flow induced in a fluid sandwiched in the
gap between two concentric cylinders of different sizes. To induce flow,
the inner cylinder was rotated, which drags the fluid next to the wall
along with it (Fig. 6.3a). This is now called Couette flow.
In some ways this is similar to flow down a parallel-sided channel,
which we considered in Chapter 2: at low rotation speeds, the fluid’s
velocity changes smoothly across the flow profile, so that the fluid can
be regarded as a series of thin layers sliding past one another (Fig. 6.3b).
(This is precisely why smooth flows of this sort are said to be laminar, as
in a laminate.) But one key difference is that a rotating object experiences a centrifugal force—the force that pulls tight the string when a
threaded weight is spun in a circle. So not only is the fluid carried
around in circles, but it is simultaneously forced outwards. As ever,
Fig. 6.3: In the apparatus devised by Maurice Couette, a fluid is held
within two concentric cylindrical drums, and is set in motion by rotating
the inner drum (a). Geoffrey Taylor later modified the device such that
the outer drum might be rotated too. The fluid is dragged along by
friction at the interface with the inner cylinder, and can be considered
to move in a series of concentric shells with different velocities—a
shear flow (b).
170 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
viscous drag resists this outwards force, so that for low rotation speeds
the centrifugal force does not appear to affect the flow.
But the British mathematician Geoffrey Taylor found in 1923 that,
once the centrifugal force starts to overwhelm the damping effect of
viscosity, patterns appear. First, the column of fluid develops stripes
(Fig. 6.4a). These are in fact roll-like vortices in which the fluid
circulates in alternate directions, as if around the surfaces of a stack
of doughnuts. Like Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection, this is a symmetrybreaking process that creates a pattern of a well-defined size.
It isn’t too hard to see that this situation is closely analogous to
convection, in which the same kind of symmetry-breaking structure
(roll cells) is created. All the fluid in the inner part of the Couette flow
‘tries’ simultaneously to move outwards because of the centrifugal
force. But it cannot simply pass through the outer layers. At a threshold
rotation speed, the system becomes unstable so that roll vortices transFig. 6.4: Various
patterns form in Couette
flow as the rotation
speed of the inner drum
(and thus the Reynolds
number) increases. First,
a stack of doughnutshaped roll cells is
formed (a). These then
develop wavy
undulations (b). At
higher Reynolds number,
the roll cells persist but
each of them contains
turbulent fluid (c).
Finally, the fluid
becomes fully turbulent
(d). But even here, the
turbulence may be

space: there is a region

amidst the turbulence.

INTO THE MAELSTROM j 171
port part of the inner fluid to the outer edge while a return flow
replenishes the inner layer. Not only is the instability of the same
basic nature as that in convection, but the shape of the rolls is the
same: roughly square, as wide as the gap between the inner and outer
cylinders.
The ‘dimensionless number’ that characterizes the driving force for
flow is again the Reynolds number. Here it is defined according to the
velocity of the flow at the surface of the inner cylinder, while the
characteristic dimension of the system is the width of the gap between
the two cylinders. Taylor performed a calculation analogous to
Rayleigh’s for convection, to work out when the roll cells—now known
as Taylor vortices—will appear as the Reynolds number is increased.
Increasing this driving force further by spinning the apparatus more
rapidly produces a progressive elaboration of the basic stripy pattern.
First the roll cells become wavy, undulating up and down around the
cylinders (Fig. 6.4b); then the waves get more complex before becoming
more or less turbulent—after which the stacked stripes reappear with
turbulence inside them (Fig. 6.4c). Finally, when the Reynolds number
is about 1,000 times the value at which the pattern first appears, the
whole column of fluid becomes an unstructured wall of turbulence
(Fig. 6.4d).
But there is more. Taylor realized that the game changes if, instead of
keeping the outer cylinder fixed, we let that rotate as well. Then the
fluid can experience significant centrifugal forces even when the relative rotation speed of the inner layer with respect to the outer is small,
and so a different balance of forces can be established. Experiments on
a system like this have revealed a menagerie of patterns, too numerous
to show here: interpenetrating spirals, wavy vortices, corkscrew wavelets, spiral turbulence. As we have seen, some of these flow patterns
may be analogous to those found in a rotating planetary atmosphere.
Hidden order
If you drive a fluid flow hard enough you will always end up with
turbulence—with chaotic flows that constantly shift. But there are
several ways in which the transition to turbulence may come about.
For convection, the switch tends to be abrupt. In the wakes of shear
flows, such as fluid flowing around an obstacle, turbulence first comes
172 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
and goes intermittently, and only takes hold fully when the flow is
faster. In Taylor–Couette flow, turbulence and regular patterns can
coexist for a while in the form of turbulent Taylor vortices. There are
many routes to turbulence, and those taken by particular types of flow
are still being debated.
When turbulence does finally arrive in earnest, however, we might be
tempted to give up looking for any pattern in it all. The trajectories of
the fluid particles become extremely convoluted and ephemeral, and
the Navier–Stokes equations can be solved only by laborious computer
calculations, not by mathematical ingenuity. A turbulent fluid is in a
state of continual instability: you could say that every single thing that
happens in the flow is catastrophic, perturbing everything else. This
means that we generally cannot predict anything about how the flow
will evolve or where any particles carried within it will be at any point in
time. (It does not mean, however, that the Navier–Stokes equations
break down, but instead that these equations no longer have solutions
that remain unchanging in time.)
In this situation, rather than trying to look at the detailed pattern of
flow in terms of streamlines, we are better off just asking about average
features—in other words, we must forget about individual trajectories
of fluid particles and consider instead their statistical properties. Then,
even apparently random, structureless systems like turbulent fluids
prove to have characteristic forms, just as we found a kind of nonrandom ‘order’ emerging from the self-organized landslides of sand
grains in Chapter 4. In this way we might be able to distinguish one
kind of apparently chaotic process from another by comparing their
statistical forms. We will see in Book III some further illustrations of this
important concept of ‘statistical form’.
The idea that turbulent flows have a generic statistical ‘shape’ which
can be measured quantitatively has been explored throughout the last
century. In the 1920s the Englishman Lewis Fry Richardson proposed
that the ‘universal’ properties of turbulence should become apparent if
we divide it up into the average ‘global’ fluid velocity and the deviations
from that average (the fluctuations) at each point. We can think of a
fluid as having a particular flow velocity (speed and direction) at every
point (a ‘velocity field’), as though each little parcel of fluid were like
one of the swarming particles we encountered in the previous chapter.
Most turbulent flows have non-zero mean velocities: the fluid does ‘get
somewhere’, albeit in a haphazard fashion. Think, for example, of the
INTO THE MAELSTROM j 173
turbulent wake in river flow past a pillar, or a turbulent jet of smoke
exhaled by an office worker as he stands fashionably exiled in the cold
outdoors. Richardson suggested that the generic behaviour of turbulence resides in the statistics of the fluctuations, from which any average flow must first be subtracted.
He proposed that any structure buried in the fluctuating, chaotic part
of the velocity field could be revealed by considering how the differences in velocity at two points within the flow vary as the points get
farther apart. There is no single answer to this: it’s a matter of collecting
statistics. If the flow is totally random at all scales, the velocity at one
point will bear no relation to that at any other: all differences in velocity
will occur with equal probability as the points get further apart. If the
flow has a structure, however, like a convection cell, the velocities at
different points will tend to be related to one another in some nonrandom way, so that knowing one allows us to predict (or at least
estimate) the other. In such a case, the velocities are said to be correlated. For example, the velocities in adjacent edges of two roll cells are
not independent: if the fluid at a point on one edge is going upwards,
we can be sure that the fluid at a corresponding point on the edge of the
other cell is also moving upwards at about the same speed, because
adjacent rolls are always counter-rotating.
In economics, some market traders spend a lot of time looking for
correlations between stock prices, so that one may be forecast from
another, or so that the price at some point in the future can be deduced
from that today. It seems clear that correlations in time disappear
rather quickly in stock price fluctuations—but if they can be glimpsed,
there may be money to be made if you are swift enough. As it happens,
it has been suggested (albeit controversially) that price correlations in
economics may show some similarity to those of turbulent fluid flow—
in which case, talk of ‘market turbulence’ is not purely metaphorical.
If turbulence has inherent structures that distinguish it from utter
randomness, there will be some correlation between the velocities at
different points in the flow. Intuitively we should expect that in a
chaotic flow such correlations, if they exist at all, will be less strong
the further apart the points are. Notice that in a perfectly ordered array
of Rayleigh–Be ´nard convection cells this is not the case: the correlations are very long-ranged, since the cells are arranged in an orderly
manner. Yet experiments have shown not only that there are correlations in turbulence, but that these have a remarkably long reach,
174 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
generally extending over almost the entire width of the flow. It is as
though individuals in a jabbering crowd were able to converse with one
another from opposite sides of a room.
These correlations make a description of turbulence a subtle business. They are responsible for its elegant, baroque beauty, a confection
of swirling, vortex-like structures of many different sizes. Fully fledged
turbulence is often patchy, in fact resembling a sluggish river, in which
regions of intense disorder and ‘swirliness’ are superimposed on a more
quiescent background. We saw in Chapter 2 that one of the fundamental structures of turbulence is the whirlpool-like vortex or eddy. But
whereas in pre-turbulent flow the eddies may form highly regular
patterns such as Ka ´rma ´n vortex streets, turbulent eddies are formed
over a very wide range of size scales, and they are transient (like
Jupiter’s Great Red Spot) and might appear anywhere in the flow.
Eddies carry much of the energy of a turbulent flow. Whereas in a
laminar flow the energy is borne along in the direction of the fluid
motion, in turbulent flow only a part of the motional (kinetic) energy
of the fluid gets anywhere—the rest is captured by eddies, which fritter
it away, in the end dissipating it in frictional heating as one parcel of
fluid rubs against another. (This friction is the origin of viscosity.) The
dissipation of kinetic energy happens at very small length scales, as
the molecules in the fluid collide and increase their thermal jiggling. So
the energy that is fed into the flow at large scales, creating big eddies
that we can see, finds its way by degrees down to these small scales
before being dissipated. In other words, there is an energy cascade: big
eddies transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at ever
smaller scales. Richardson appreciated this, and in 1922 he coined a
rhyme, inspired by Jonathon Swift’s doggerel about fleas, to describe
the process:
Big whirls have little whirls
that feed on their velocity,
and little whirls have lesser whirls
and so on to viscosity.
In the 1940s the Russian physicist Andrei Kolmogorov put this energy
cascade into precise mathematical form. He proposed that the energy
contained in a turbulent fluid at a length scale d varies in proportion to
the 5/3rd power of d—in other words, it increases as d gets larger at a
rate proportional to slightly less than the square of d. Compare this with
INTO THE MAELSTROM j 175
how the area of a circle of diameter d increases with d: in that case, it
does so at a rate proportional to d squared.* This is another example of
a power law (see Chapter 4), also called a scaling law because it describes how some quantity varies with a change of scale. Scaling laws
are central to the science that underlies many natural patterns and
forms—we will encounter others in Book III.
Kolmogorov’s law no doubt sounds rather abstract, but what it tells
us is that there is a kind of logic to the process of turbulent flow which
governs the way energy gets distributed in the fluid. It turns out that his
scaling law is often found to be slightly inaccurate when investigated
experimentally, since Kolmogorov made slightly too simplistic an assumption in deriving it. But more recent theories of turbulence have
shown that things can be put right by including a few other ingredients
in the scaling law. The basic idea of an energy cascade, in which the
energy magnification in the fluid flow at different scales is described by
a power law, is correct.
It is not obvious what this law implies for the way turbulence looks.
There is, however, a rather delightful way of illustrating this. We have
seen already that one of the characteristic forms of turbulent flow is the
vortex or eddy. When, in 2004, scientists using the Hubble Space
Telescope saw such features in a turbulent, expanding cloud of dust
and gas around a distant star (Fig. 6.5a), it reminded them of Vincent
van Gogh’s famous painting Starry Night (Fig. 6.5b), which he
completed in a mental asylum at St-Remy in 1889, a year before his
death. Such comparisons prompted a team of scientists in Spain,
Mexico, and England to wonder whether van Gogh’s trademark
swirly style is genuinely turbulent in a scientific sense. To assess this,
they looked at whether the statistical distribution of brightness variations in the painting has the form that Kolmogorov specified for
turbulent flow.
From digitized images, the researchers measured the statistics of
how the brightness varied between any two pixels a certain distance
apart. They reasoned that this distribution can be considered analogous to the variations in velocity of fluid parcels in a turbulent flow—
which, according to Kolmogorov’s theory, should obey particular power
*If you increase the diameter of a circle by a factor of 10, you increase its area by a factor of
102 ¼ 100. But if you compare a patch of turbulent fluid with another one ten times the
width, the energy in the latter is greater by a factor of 105/3, or about 47.
176 j NATURE’S PATTERNS: FLOW
laws.* For Starry Night, these correspondences hold fast with impressive accuracy. In other words, the painting gives a technically accurate
representation of what Kolmogorov’s turbulence ‘looks like’.
The same is true for Van Gogh’s Road with Cypress and Star and
Wheat Field with Crows, both painted in a particularly disturbed period
in early 1890 (the second of these paintings was the last he completed
Fig. 6.5: Turbulence seen in interstellar gas and dust around the star V838 Monocerotis (V838 Mon),
about 20,000 light-years away from Earth in the direction of the constellation Monoceros (a). The image
was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2004. The dust is illuminated by a flash of light
emitted from V383 Mon, a red supergiant star, at the middle of the picture. This image made astronomers
think of Van Gogh’s famous painting Starry Night (1889) (b). (Photos: a, NASA, the Hubble Heritage
Team (AURA/STScI) and ESA. b, Digital image copyright 2008, Museum of Modern Art/Scala, Florence.)
*To be specific: Kolmogorov’s work led to the prediction that the distribution of velocity
differences between two points, dv, obeys a series of different power laws corresponding to
different powers of dv: there is one law for dv2, one for dv3, and so on. The researchers
searched for similar power-law relationships governing the differences in brightness in Van
Gogh’s painting.
INTO THE MAELSTROM j 177
before he shot himself). But his notorious Self-portrait with Pipe and
Bandaged Ear (1888) doesn’t show the imprint of ‘turbulence’. Could
this be because it was executed while in a self-confessed state of calm,
after he had been hospitalized and treated with potassium bromide
for his psychosis? It is perhaps rather fanciful to imagine that Van
Gogh’s mental ‘turbulence’ gave him the ability to intuit the forms of
real turbulent flow. But, whatever the reason, he was clearly able to
do so on some occasions, and it may be for this reason that we can
sense so strongly the discord, the constant and always imminent dissolution of order into chaos, in an image like Starry Night. We have
seen this wild pattern before.

saucepan on a cooker. The base of the pan must be flat and smooth,
however, and preferably also thick to distribute the heat evenly. A skillet
works well. The oil layer need be only about 1–2 mm deep. The flow
pattern can be revealed by sprinkling a powdered spice such as cinnamon on to the surface of the oil.
For a more controlled experiment, silicone oil works better. This is
commercially available in a range of viscosities, and a viscosity of
0.5 cm2/s is generally about right. The convection cells can be seen
more clearly if metal powder is suspended in the fluid (see Fig. 3.1).
Bronze powder can be obtained from hardware shops or art material
suppliers. Aluminium flakes can be extracted from the pigment of
‘silver’ model paints by decanting the liquid and then washing the
residual flakes in acetone (nail-varnish remover). These powders will
settle in silicone oil if left to stand.
These procedures are based on:

Grain Stratification

T HIS and dependable result for rather little effort. I have used it in several demonstration lectures—it is portable and reusable, and is one of the most satisfying experiments, giving a dramatic
always elicits a satisfying response. I understand that the discoverers of
the effect at Boston University have made a cell 2 feet high for such
demonstrations.
My Makse cell is no masterpiece of engineering, but it is quick and
easy to make. It is convenient to make the transparent plates detachable so that they can be cleaned. Ideally they should also be treated
with an anti-static agent, such as those used on vinyl records, to prevent grains from sticking to the surface—but this isn’t essential.
The plates are 20 by 30 cm, with a gap of 5 mm between them. The
cells described in the original paper by Makse et al. (1997) were left
open at one end, but an endpiece at both ends ensures that the plates
remain parallel and means that the layers can fill up the cell completely,
which gives a more attractive and easily visible effect.
The prettiest results are achieved with coloured sand grains, which
can be bought from some chemical suppliers. But granulated sugar and
ordinary sand (cleaned, from a pet shop or from children’s sand pits)
are easier to get hold of, and have enough of a difference in grain size,
shape and colour to produce visible layering. The sugar grains are larger
and more square—table salt is too similar to sand, and so it doesn’t
segregate well. The best results are obtained by pouring a 50:50 mixture
of grains at a slow and steady rate into one corner of the cell. For a
funnel, all you need is an envelope of about A5 size with the tip of
a corner cut off.

Plate 1 When two dipolar vortices collide, the structures maintain their integrity. The mushroom-like heads exchange
vortices and set off in new directions. Here they have been coloured with dyes so that they are identifiable.
(Photos: GertJan van Heijst and Jan-Bert Flór, University of Utrecht.
Plate 3 The bands that encircle Jupiter are flow patterns called zonal jets.
(Photo: NASA.)
Plate 2 Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is an example of a coherent structure in turbulent flow. It has persisted in
Jupiter’s swirling atmosphere for at least 300 years. Other, short-lived structures have come and go.
(Photo: NASA.)
Plate 4 a, In these computer simulations of atmospheric flow on
Jupiter, a hemisphere of the planet is
flattened out into a disk around
which the gases rotate. Two vortices
are imprinted on the flow at the
outset, one (red) rotating in the
same direction as the mean flow
and the other (blue) rotating in the
opposite direction. The first of these
remains stable as time progresses
(top to bottom and left to right),
even though the flow is turbulent.
But the second is pulled apart,
breaking up into a mass of tiny
whorls. Then the red vortex swallows
up these little whirlpools, purging
them from the general flow.
b, Two large vortices, both with the
same rotation direction as the mean
flow, merge into one—the ‘oneeyed’ state is the stable state of this
system. (Images: Philip Marcus,
University of California at Berkeley.)

model of Jupiter’s flow in a
rotating tank of liquid produces a model ‘Red Spot’,
revealed here by injecting dye
into the fluid. (Photo: Harry
