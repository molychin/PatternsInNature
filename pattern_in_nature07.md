Ripples in nature
The clock like switching between a red-filled and blue-filled flask is pretty to behold, but the process is capable of more than this. If you mix the components of the BZ reaction, pour them into a flat dish, and leave them to do their thing,you see something considerably more spectacular than a uniform color change. Instead, the switch to a new color starts at a few specific spots in the liquid and spreads out from there, producing circular patches. In the wake of this spreading wave, the mixture starts to revert to the other color. But then a new wave springs from the same spot in the next cycle of the oscillation. The process repeats again and again with a regular pulse, producing concentric circular waves of color that grow like ripples on a pond where a stone has fallen in. These are chemical waves, driven by the competition of reaction and diffusion.  
Patterns produced by chemical waves are seen in a wide range of different chemical systems. They are formed on the surfaces of metals that catalyze the reactions between gas molecules sticking to the metal; here the patterns are generally microscopically small. And if the concentric bands remind you of the patterns found in minerals such as onyx and agate, that seems to be no coincidence. These bands are formed by the crystallization of different mineral types when the stones grow from warm, saltladen fluids in the Earth’s crust as the fluids cool.

自然界的涟漪  
时钟在红色填充和蓝色填充烧瓶之间切换是很明显的，但是这个过程的能力远远不止于此。如果你把BZ反应的成分混合在一起，把它们倒进一个扁平的盘子里，让它们做它们的事情，你会看到比均匀的颜色变化更引人注目的东西。相反，切换到一个新的颜色开始在液体中的几个特定点，并从那里展开，产生圆形补丁。在这种扩展波之后，混合物开始回复到另一种颜色。但是，在下一个振荡周期中，一个新的波从同一个点弹出。这个过程一次又一次的重复着一个规则的脉冲，产生一个同心的圆形波，就像一个石头落在池塘里的涟漪。这些是化学波，由反应和扩散的竞争驱动。  
化学波产生的模式见于各种不同的化学体系中。它们形成在金属表面上，催化气体分子粘附在金属上的反应；这里的图案通常是微观上小的。如果同心带提醒你在矿物中发现的图案，如玛瑙和玛瑙，那似乎不是巧合。这些带是由不同矿物类型的结晶形成的，当石头在地球地壳中从温暖、含盐流体中生长时，流体冷却。

It seems that this crystallization process happens in waves that are much like the chemical waves of the BZ reaction, only in this case frozen in place for millennia.  
The target and spiral patterns of the BZ reaction look just like those made by Dictyostelium discoideum as the slime-mold cells search each other out to form their life-preserving “mushroom.” Both are chemical reactions of a kind, but very different: in one case there’s just a soup of simple ingredients, in the other there are swimming cells that are emitting pulses of chemical attractant. And as we saw earlier, the surges in these systems also look like the waves of electrical activity that pass through heart muscle to trigger the rhythmic contractions of the heartbeat. How come the patterns are so similar in such diverse systems?

That’s because in all cases the basics are the same, irrespective of the details. The whole “fabric” of these systems—the solution of chemicals, the colony of cells, the heart tissue—is capable of switching between two different states, and that switching involves feedback processes and auto-catalysis. It’s even the same for the foxes and rabbits: if, say, the initial rabbit population varies slightly in number from one place to another in the landscape, at random, then patches where the population is denser might become the source of waves of population growth that radiate outward—followed close after by waves of glutted foxes.

似乎这种结晶过程发生在波，很像BZ反应的化学波，只有在这种情况下，在几千年内冻结。  
BZ反应的靶标和螺旋状与盘基网柄菌所形成的黏黏细胞一样，互相寻找，以形成其保存生命的“蘑菇”。两者都是一种化学反应，但非常不同：在一种情况下，只有一种简单的汤。成分，另一种是有化学吸引物脉冲的游泳池。正如我们之前看到的，这些系统中的浪涌也像是通过心脏肌肉的电活动波，触发心跳的节律收缩。为什么在这样多样的系统中模式是如此相似？  
这是因为在所有情况下，基本细节都是一样的，不管细节如何。这些系统的整个“织物”——化学物质的解决方案，细胞的集合，心脏组织能够在两种不同的状态之间切换，并且切换涉及反馈过程和自动催化。狐狸和兔子也是一样的：如果说，最初的兔子数量在数量上从一个地方到另一个地方在数量上是随机变化的，那么人口密集的斑块可能会成为人口增长的来源，辐射波随C向外辐射。被贪食的狐狸迷住了。

Reaction-diffusion processes can explain the wavy pigment patterns formed on the shells of mollusks such as shellfish and snails (invisibly small spirals may also appear among the microsopic terraces of the shell mineral itself). The positive feedback that produces such pattern features also seems to be at work in the formation of dunes and ripples in wind-blown desert sand. Dunes can take on many forms: the parallel ranks of longitudinal dunes; seif dunes that undulate like snakes; isolated crescent-shaped mounds called barchan dunes; and star dunes, with several arms radiating from a central peak rather like a starfish. Dunes have been seen on Mars, which also has vast sandy deserts stirred by winds—but the different planetary conditions may produce patterns found nowhere on Earth. There are even dunes on Saturn’s moon Titan, with grains made not of sand but of frozen hydrocarbon compounds, a bit like wax, perhaps coated with ice. They are a striking reminder that self-organized pattern formation is a feature of the cosmos: the details may change but the basic processes stay the same. It’s for this reason that no world is likely to be tot ally alien to us.

反应扩散过程可以解释贝类和蜗牛等软体动物贝壳上形成的波浪状色素（在壳矿物本身的微斜面上也可能出现不可见的小螺旋）。产生这种模式特征的正反馈也似乎在风沙沙漠中沙丘和波纹的形成中起作用。沙丘可以有多种形式：平行沙丘的纵向沙丘；起伏的沙丘，波浪状的蛇；孤立的新月形土丘，称为新月形沙丘；以及星状沙丘，有几个臂从中央峰辐射，相当于海星。沙丘已经在Mars上看到了，这里也有巨大的沙尘被风搅动，但是不同的行星条件可能会产生地球上没有发现的模式。土星的卫星泰坦上甚至有沙丘，沙粒不是沙子，而是冰冻的碳氢化合物，有点像蜡，也许涂上了冰。它们是一个惊人的提醒，自组织模式的形成是宇宙的一个特征：细节可能改变，但基本过程保持不变。正因为这个原因，没有一个世界可能与我们完全陌生。


1 CHEMICAL WAVES  
A mixture of chemical ingredients called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction undergoes oscillations, first producing products of one color (red) and then another (blue) as time ticks by (see above). If the reaction is left to proceed in an unstirred, flat dish, the oscillations create waves that emanate from some central point,making these concentric target and spiral patterns. The wave fronts annihilate each other when they touch.

1化学波  
被称为Belousov Zhabotinsky反应的化学成分的混合物经历振荡，首先产生一种颜色（红色），然后产生另一种（蓝色），随着时间的推移（见上文）。如果反应在未搅拌的平盘中继续进行，则振荡产生从一些中心点发出的波，使这些同心目标和螺旋模式。波阵面在它们接触时相互湮灭。

2 SHELL PATTERNS  
The shells of some bivalves may develop microscopic spiral and target patterns engraved on the growing biomineral surface, which look very similar to those produced by chemical waves in the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction.

2壳模式  
一些双壳类的壳可以在生长的生物矿物表面上雕刻出微小的螺旋状和靶状图案，看起来与BelousovZhabotinsky反应中化学波产生的相似。


RIPPLING PATTERNS  
Ridges in wind-blown sand and pigmentation patterns on mollusk shells are both a kind of frozen wave. The sand ripples are in fact still slowly changing, as fresh sand is deposited by the wind. The regular spacing is dictated by interactions between each ripple. The shell patterns are produced by waves of pigmentation moving along the rim of the shell as it is formed, in a process thought to bear some similarities to the way chemical waves arise in the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction.

纹波图案  
风沙脊和软体动物壳上的色素沉着模式都是一种冻结波。事实上，沙尘暴是缓慢变化的，因为新鲜沙子是被风沉积的。规则间隔由每个纹波之间的相互作用决定。壳层图案是由形成在其周围的壳边缘的色素波产生的，这一过程被认为与BelousovZhabotinsky反应中化学波产生的方式有一些相似之处。


WAVES OF PIGMENTATION  
As mollusk shells grow, pigmented material is sometimes laid down along the rim. If there are periodic bursts of pigmented and unpigmented growth, the result is banding perpendicular to the axis of the conical shell. If pigmentation happens at fixed spots around the rim, the result is stripes parallel to this axis. And if the pigmentation occurs as waves that progress steadily around the rim, it produces slanting stripes. All of these are akin to the way chemical-wave patterns form.

色素沉着波  
随着软体动物壳的生长，色素物质有时沿着边缘沉积下来。如果有周期性爆发的着色和未着色的增长，结果是绑扎垂直于圆锥壳的轴线。如果色素沉着发生在边缘周围的固定点，结果是平行于该轴的条纹。如果色素沉着像波浪一样稳定地围绕着轮辋，就会产生倾斜的条纹。所有这些都类似于化学波模式的形成方式。


ROCK PATTERNS  
In some minerals, such as the agates shown here, waves of crystallization as the mineral is formed produce a frozen record of the so-called “reaction-diffusion” process underlying it.

岩石模式  
在一些矿物中，如这里所示的玛瑙，形成矿物的结晶波产生了所谓的“反应-扩散”过程的冻结记录。

DESERT’S TEETH  
These irregular, wavy dunes in the Namib desert of Namibia are among the highest in the world, reaching up to 984 feet (300 meters). The bluish region is a dried-up river bed, with white encrustations of salt. A road is just about visible as a narrow lightblue line running through its center.

沙漠牙齿  
纳米比亚纳米比亚沙漠中这些不规则起伏的沙丘是世界上最高的，达984英尺（300米）。蓝色的区域是干涸的河床，有白色的盐覆盖层。一条道路几乎可以看得见，就像一条狭窄的淡蓝色线穿过它的中心。


BACTERIAL ART  
Chemical communication between bacterial cells can make the colony grow into complex shapes, such as these intricately branched structures. Occasionally a random genetic mutation in the colony might convey an advantage that suddenly switches the shape of growth, as the mutant proliferates faster than the others.

细菌艺术  
细菌细胞之间的化学通讯可以使菌落生长成复杂的形状，如这些错综复杂的分支结构。偶尔，在殖民地的随机基因突变可能传达的优势，突然切换生长的形状，因为突变体增殖比其他人更快。

DUNES ON MARS  
Winds blow across the sandy deserts of Mars, and form dunes and other patterns just as they do on Earth. Some of these echo the dune shapes seen on Earth, such as the crescent-shaped barchan dunes (1), but others have shapes not found on our planet. That’s because there are different conditions on Mars that affect the way grains are transported and how they bounce: the gravity is weaker, the atmosphere is thinner, and the winds can be much faster

火星上的沙丘  
风吹过Mars的沙漠，形成沙丘和其他图案，就像在地球上一样。其中一些与地球上出现的沙丘形状相呼应，例如新月形新月形沙丘（1），但其他的形状在我们的星球上却没有。这是因为Mars上有不同的条件影响谷物运输的方式以及它们如何反弹：重力较弱，大气更薄，风也快得多。

6 BUBBLES & FOAM  
Why bees know best and why froth inspires architects

气泡与泡沫  
蜜蜂为什么最了解为什么泡沫激发建筑师

HEXAGONAL NEST CELLS  
A wasp (Vespula vulgaris) working on its nest. Why and how does it make the cells hexagonal?

六角巢细胞  
在巢穴里工作的黄蜂（Vespula vulgaris）。为什么和怎样使细胞变成六角形？

“To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling,” wrote the English scientist John Herschel in 1830. “A soap bubble…an apple…a pebble. He walks in the midst of wonders.” Soap bubbles might indeed seem like trifling child’s play, but some of the finest minds in science have been captured by their charm and beauty, as well as perplexed by their shapes. Soap films and foams observe a particular economy, a precise balance of shaping agencies that stretches and pushes them into graceful curves and frameworks. Nature sometimes makes ingenious use of these patterns to build architectures that are both useful and extravagant.

1830岁的英国科学家约翰·弗里德里希·威廉写道：“对自然哲学家来说，没有自然物体是不重要的，也不是微不足道的。”一个肥皂泡…一个苹果…一块鹅卵石。他走在一片奇观之中，“肥皂泡似乎真的像儿戏，但科学上最优秀的一些人却被他们的魅力和美貌所迷惑，也被他们的形状所迷惑。肥皂膜和泡沫观察到特定的经济，精确的平衡机构，伸展和推动他们进入优美的曲线和框架。自然有时会巧妙地利用这些模式来建造既有用又奢侈的建筑。

How do bees do it? The honeycombs in which they store their amber nectar and nurture their larvae are marvels of precision engineering, an array of prism-shaped cells with a perfectly hexagonal cross-section. The wax walls are made with a very precise thickness, the cells are gently tilted from the horizontal to prevent the viscous honey from running out, and the entire comb is aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field.
Yet this structure is made without any blueprint or foresight, by many bees working simultaneously and somehow coordinating their efforts to avoid mismatched cells.

蜜蜂是怎么做到的？它们储存琥珀花蜜和培育幼虫的蜂窝是精密工程的奇迹，一组棱柱形的细胞具有完美的六边形横截面。蜡壁用非常精确的厚度制成，细胞从水平方向轻轻倾斜以防止粘稠的蜂蜜流出，整个梳子与地球磁场对齐。  
然而，这种结构是没有任何蓝图或远见，许多蜜蜂同时工作，不知何故协调他们的努力，以避免不匹配的细胞。

The ancient Greek philosopher Pappus of Alexandria thought that the bees must be endowed with “a certain geometrical forethought.” And who could have given them this wisdom, but God? According to William Kirby in 1852, bees are “Heaven-instructed mathematicians.” Charles Darwin wasn’t so sure, and he conducted experiments to establish whether bees are able to build perfect honeycombs using nothing but evolved and inherited instincts, as his theory of evolution would imply.
Why hexagons, though? It’s a simple matter of geometry. If you want to pack together cells that are identical in shape and size so that they fill all of a flat plane, only three regular shapes (with all sides and angles identical) will work:
equilateral triangles, squares, and hexagons. Of these, hexagonal cells require the least total length of wall, compared with triangles or squares of the same area. So it makes sense that bees would choose hexagons, since making wax costs them energy, and they will want to use up as little as possible—just as builders might want to save on the cost of bricks. This was understood in the eighteenth century, and Darwin declared that the hexagonal honeycomb is “absolutely perfect in economizing labor and wax.”

Darwin thought that natural selection had endowed bees with instincts for making these wax chambers, which had the advantage of requiring less energy and time than those with other shapes. But even though bees do seem to possess specialized abilities to measure angles and wall thickness, not everyone agrees about how much they have to rely on them. That’s because making hexagonal arrays of cells is something that nature does anyway.

亚历山大市古希腊哲学家帕帕斯认为蜜蜂必须被赋予“某种几何学的先见之明”，谁能给他们这种智慧，但上帝呢？根据William Kirby在1852，蜜蜂是“天堂指示数学家。”Charles Darwin不太确定，他做了实验，以确定蜜蜂是否能够用进化和遗传的本能来构建完美的蜂巢，正如他的进化论所暗示的那样。  
为什么六边形呢？这是一个简单的几何问题。如果你想把形状和大小相同的细胞包在一起，使它们填充一个平面，那么只有三个规则的形状（所有边和角度相同）将起作用：  
等边三角形、正方形和六边形。其中，六角形单元与相同区域的三角形或正方形相比，需要最少的总壁长。因此，蜜蜂选择六边形是有道理的，因为制作蜡会使它们消耗能量，而且他们会想尽可能少地使用，就像建筑商可能想节省砖块的成本一样。这在十八世纪被理解，达尔文宣称六角蜂窝是“完全节省劳动和蜡的完美”。  
达尔文认为自然选择赋予蜜蜂制造这些蜡室的本能，它比其他形状的人需要更少的能量和时间。但是，尽管蜜蜂确实具有专门测量角度和壁厚的能力，但并不是每个人都同意它们必须依靠它们。这是因为制造六边形排列的细胞是自然界所做的事情。

Releasing the tension  
If you blow a layer of bubbles on the surface of water—a so-called “bubble raft”—the bubbles become hexagonal, or almost so. You’ll never find a raft of square bubbles: if four bubble walls come together, they instantly rearrange into three-wall junctions with more or less equal angles of 120˚ between them, like the center of the MercedesBenz symbol.
Evidently there are no agents shaping these rafts as bees do with their combs. All that’s guiding the pattern are the laws of physics. Those laws evidently have definite preferences, such as the bias toward three-way junctions of bubble walls. The same is true of more complicated foams. If you pile up bubbles in three dimensions by blowing through a straw into a bowl of soapy water you’ll see that when bubble walls meet at a vertex, it’s always a four-way union with angles between the intersecting films roughly equal to about 109˚—an angle related to the four-faceted geometric tetrahedron.  
What determines these rules of soap-film junctions and bubble shapes? Nature is even more concerned about economy than the bees are.

释放张力  
如果你在水面上吹一层气泡，所谓的“泡泡筏”——气泡变成六边形，或者几乎是这样。你永远找不到一排方形的泡泡：如果四个气泡墙聚集在一起，它们会立即重新排列成三个壁结，它们之间的角度大约为120°，就像梅塞德斯奔驰符号的中心一样。  
显然，没有蜜蜂用它们的梳子来塑造这些筏子。指导这一模式的一切都是物理定律。这些定律显然有明确的偏好，例如对气泡壁的三向连接点的偏倚。对于更复杂的泡沫也是如此。如果你把一根稻草吹入一碗肥皂水中，在三个维度上堆积气泡，你会发现，当气泡壁在顶点处相遇时，它总是一个四通的结合，在相交的膜之间夹角大致等于约109°-与四面土工格栅有关的角度。四面体是什么决定了肥皂膜结和气泡形状的规则？自然比蜜蜂更关心经济。

Bubbles and soap films are made of water (with a skin of soap molecules) and surface tension pulls at the liquid surface to give it as small an area as possible. That’s why raindrops are spherical (more or less) as they fall: a sphere has less surface area than any other shape with the same volume. On a waxy leaf, droplets of water retract into little beads for the same reason.  
This surface tension explains the patterns of bubble rafts and foams. The foam will seek to find the structure that has the lowest total surface tension, which means the least area of soap-film wall. But the configuration of bubble walls also has to be mechanically stable: the tugs in different directions at a junction have to balance perfectly,just as the forces must be balanced in the walls of a cathedral if the building is going to stand up.

气泡和肥皂膜是由水（具有肥皂分子的皮肤）和表面张力拉到液体表面，使它尽可能小的面积。这就是雨滴落下时是球形（或多或少）的原因：一个球体的表面积比任何体积相同的形状都要小。在一片蜡质的叶子上，由于同样的原因，水滴收缩成小珠。  
这种表面张力解释了气泡筏和泡沫的模式。泡沫将寻求找到具有最低总表面张力的结构，这意味着肥皂膜壁的最小面积。但是，泡墙的结构也必须是机械稳定的：在一个结处的不同方向上的拖曳物必须完美地平衡，就像在建筑物的壁上必须平衡的力量一样。

The three-way junction in a bubble raft, and the four-way junctions in foam, are the configurations that achieve this balance.  
But those who think (as some do) that the honeycomb is just a solidified bubble raft of soft wax might have trouble explaining how the same hexagonal array of cells is found in the nests of paper wasps, who build not with wax but with chewed-up wads of fibrous wood and plant stem,from which they make a kind of paper. Not only can surface tension have little effect here, but it also seems clear that different types of wasp have different inherited instincts for their architectural designs, which can vary significantly from one species to another.  
Although the geometry of soap-film junctions is dictated by this interplay of mechanical forces, it doesn’t tell us what the shape of the foam will be.

泡沫筏中的三通结和泡沫中的四通结是实现这种平衡的结构。  
但是那些认为（蜂巢）只是一个固化的软蜡泡泡筏的人可能无法解释如何在纸黄蜂巢中发现同样的六角形排列的细胞，它们不是用蜡而是用咀嚼的纤维木和植物茎来制造的。克是一种纸。不仅表面张力在这里几乎没有影响，而且似乎也很清楚，不同类型的黄蜂对它们的建筑设计有不同的遗传本能，这可以从一个物种到另一个物种显著地变化。  
虽然肥皂膜结的几何形状是由机械力的相互作用决定的，但它并不能告诉我们泡沫的形状。

A typical foam contains polyhedral cells of many different shapes and sizes. Look closely and you’ll see that their edges are rarely perfectly straight;they’re a little curved. That’s because the pressure of the gas inside a cell or bubble gets bigger as the bubble gets smaller, so the wall of a small bubble next to a larger one will bulge outward slightly. What’s more, some facets have five sides,some six, and some just four or even three. With a little bending of the walls, all of these shapes can acquire four-way junctions close to the “tetrahedral” arrangement needed for mechanical stability. So there’s a fair bit of flexibility (literally) in the shapes of the cells. Foams, while subject to geometrical rules, are rather disorderly.  
Suppose that you could make a “perfect” foam in which all the bubbles are the same size.

一个典型的泡沫包含许多不同形状和大小的多面体细胞。仔细观察，你会发现它们的边缘很少是完全直的，它们有点弯曲。这是因为当气泡变小时，细胞内或气泡内的气体压力越大，气泡越靠近大气泡的壁就会向外轻微膨胀。更重要的是，一些方面有五个方面，大约六个，一些只是四个甚至三个。由于墙壁有点弯曲，所有这些形状都能获得接近机械稳定性所需的“四面体”排列的四通结。所以在细胞的形状上有相当的灵活性（字面意思）。泡沫虽然受到几何规律的影响，却相当无序。  
假设你可以做一个“完美”的泡沫，其中所有的气泡都是相同的大小。

What then is the ideal cell shape that makes the total bubble wall area as small as possible while satisfying the demands for the angles at the junctions? That has been debated for many years, and for a long time it was thought that the ideal cell shape was a 14-sided polyhedron with square and hexagonal faces. But in 1993 a slightly more economical—although less orderly—structure was discovered, consisting of a repeating group of eight different cell shapes. This more complex pattern was used as the inspiration for the foamlike design of the swimming stadium of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
The rules of cell shape in foams also control some of the patterns seen in living cells. Not only does a fly’s compound eye show the same hexagonal packing of facets as a bubble raft, but the light-sensitive cells within each of the individual lenses are also clustered in groups of four that look just like soap bubbles. In mutant flies with more than four of these cells per cluster,the arrangements are also more or less identical to those that bubbles would adopt.

什么是理想的细胞形状，使总气泡壁面积尽可能小，同时满足在路口的角度的要求？这已经争论了多年，长期以来，人们认为理想的细胞形状是具有正方形和六边形的14面多面体。但是在1993，发现了一个稍微经济些的，虽然结构不太有序，由一组重复的八个不同的细胞形状组成。这种更复杂的模式被用作北京2008奥运会游泳馆泡沫设计的灵感。  
泡沫中细胞形状的规则也控制了活细胞中的一些模式。苍蝇的复眼不仅表现出与气泡筏相同的六角形包装面，而且每一个单独透镜中的感光细胞也聚集成四组，看起来就像肥皂泡。在每个簇中有超过四的这些细胞的突变苍蝇，排列也或多或少与气泡所采用的相同。


REPEATED SHAPES  
Soap foams are made up of polyhedral bubbles, with flat faces and more or less regular shapes.  
Their geometry is determined by a small set of approximate rules.

重复形状  
肥皂泡沫是由多面体气泡组成的，具有平坦的表面和规则的形状。  
它们的几何结构由一组近似的规则决定。

The economics of surfaces  
Because of surface tension, a soap film stretching across a loop of wire is pulled flat like the springy membrane of a trampoline. If the wire frame is bent, the film also bends with an elegant contour that automatically tells you the most economical way, in terms of material, to cover over the space enclosed by the frame. That can show an architect how to make a roof for a complicated structure using the least amount of material. However, it’s as much because of the beauty and elegance of these so-called “minimal surfaces” as because of their economy that architects such as Frei Otto have used them in their buildings.

表面经济学  
由于表面张力，一根横跨电线圈的肥皂膜被拉平，就像蹦床的弹性膜一样。如果线框被弯曲，胶片也弯曲一个优雅的轮廓，它会自动告诉你最经济的方式，在材料方面，覆盖在框架所包围的空间。这可以告诉建筑师如何用最少的材料为复杂的结构建造屋顶。然而，同样因为这些所谓的“极小表面”的美丽和优雅，因为他们的经济，像弗雷·奥托这样的建筑师在他们的建筑中使用了它们。

These surfaces minimize not only their surface area, but also their total curvature. The tighter the bend, the greater the curvature. As we saw in Chapter 1, curvature can be positive (bulges) or negative (dips, depressions, and saddles). A curved surface can therefore have zero mean curvature so long as the positives and negatives cancel each other out.
So a sheet can be full of curvature and yet have very little or even no mean curvature. Such a minimally curved surface can divide up space into an orderly labyrinth of passageways and channels—a network. These are called periodic minimal surfaces. (Periodic just means a structure that repeats identically again and again, or in other words, a regular pattern.) When such patterns were discovered in the nineteenth century, they seemed to be just a mathematical curiosity. But now we know that nature makes use of them.

这些表面不仅减小了它们的表面积，而且减小了它们的总曲率。弯曲越紧，曲率越大。正如我们在第1章中看到的，曲率可以是正的（凸起）或者是负的（凹陷、凹陷和鞍）。因此，只要正和负相互抵消，曲面就可以具有零平均曲率。  
因此，一张纸可以充满曲率，但几乎没有或甚至没有平均曲率。这种极小的曲面可以将空间分割成通道和通道的有序迷宫，这是一个网络。这些被称为周期极小曲面。（周期只是指一种重复和重复的结构，换句话说，是一种规则的模式）当这些模式在十九世纪被发现时，它们似乎只是一种数学上的好奇心。但现在我们知道大自然利用了它们。

The cells of many different types of organisms, from plants to lampreys to rats, contain membranes with microscopic structures like this.  
No one knows what they are for, but they are so widespread that it’s fair to assume they have some sort of useful role. Perhaps they isolate one biochemical process from another, avoiding crosstalk and interference. Or maybe they are just an efficient way of creating lots of “work surface, ” since many biochemical processes take place at the surface of membranes, where enzymes and other active molecules may be embedded. Whatever its function, you don’t need complicated genetic instructions to create such a labyrinth: the laws of physics will do it for you.

许多不同种类的生物细胞，从植物到灯盏花到大鼠，都含有像这样的微观结构的膜。  
没有人知道他们是干什么的，但是他们是如此广泛，所以很公平地假设他们有某种有用的作用。也许他们将一个生化过程与另一个生化过程隔离开来，避免串扰和干扰。或者，它们可能是创造大量“工作表面”的一种有效方式，因为许多生化过程发生在膜表面，其中酶和其他活性分子可以被嵌入。不管它的功能是什么，你不需要复杂的遗传指令来创造这样一个迷宫：物理定律会为你做到这一点。

Some butterflies, such as the European green hairstreak and the emerald patched cattleheart, have wing scales containing an orderly labyrinth of the tough material called chitin, shaped like a particular periodic minimal surface called the gyroid. Interference between light waves bouncing off this regular structure within the wing scale causes some wavelengths—that is, some colors— to disappear while others (in this case, green) reinforce each other. So here the patterns offer a means of producing animal color.

一些蝴蝶，如欧洲绿毛斑纹和翡翠补丁的卡特尔心脏，有翅鳞片，包含一种被称为甲壳状的特殊周期性极小表面，称为甲壳质的硬性物质的有序迷宫。在翼鳞片内从这种规则结构中弹出的光波之间的干涉会引起一些波长，即某些颜色消失，而另一些波长（在这种情况下，绿色）相互加强。因此，这些图案提供了一种产生动物颜色的方法。

BUBBLE GEOMETRY  
The junctions of soap films in the bubbles of a foam are generally fourfold, with the four edges pointing roughly to the corners of a tetrahedron.  
Note that some bubble faces are curved rather than flat, because of the differences in gas pressure within the bubbles.

气泡几何结构  
泡沫膜中肥皂膜的结通常是四倍的，四个边大致指向四面体的角。  
注意，由于气泡内气体压力的差异，一些气泡表面是弯曲的而不是平坦的。


FOAM CRYSTALS  
Diatoms, a kind of algae, are encased in a cage of hard, mineral silica called a frustule.  
This is often intricately patterned with grooves, ridges, and holes, rather like a solidified foam. It’s thought that a foam made from soft bubblelike tissue acts as a mold during the growth of the frustule.  

泡沫晶体  
硅藻是一种海藻，被包裹在坚硬的矿物硅石笼中，称为截锥体。  
这通常是复杂的图案，沟槽，脊和孔，而像凝固的泡沫。据认为，由软泡状组织制成的泡沫在截肢体的生长过程中起着霉菌的作用。


“Periodic minimal surfaces seemed to be just a mathematical curiosity. But now we know that nature makes use of them.”

“周期极小曲面似乎只是数学上的好奇心。但现在我们知道大自然利用了它们。”

Breaking the mold  
The skeleton of the sea urchin Cidaris rugosa is a porous mesh with the shape of another kind of periodic minimal surface. It’s actually an exoskeleton, sitting outside the organism’s soft tissue, a protective shell that sprouts dangerous-looking spines made from the same mineral as chalk and marble. The open lattice structure means that the material is strong without being too heavy, rather like the metal foams used for building aircraft.  
To create orderly networks from such hard, stiff mineral, these organisms apparently make a mold from soft, flexible membranes and then crystallize the hard material inside one of the interpenetrating networks. Other creatures may cast orderly mineral foams this way for more sophisticated purposes. Because of the way that light bounces off the elements of the patterned structure, such trellises can act rather like mirrors and conduits to confine and guide light. A honeycomb arrangement of hollow microscopic channels within the chitin spines of a peculiar marine worm known as the sea mouse turn these hairlike structures into natural optical fibers that can channel light, making the creature turn from red to bluish green depending on the direction of the illumination. This color change might serve to deter predators.

打破模具  
海胆Cidaris rugosa的骨架是多孔网格，具有另一种周期极小表面的形状。它实际上是一个外骨骼，坐在生物体的软组织之外，是一种保护性外壳，它能发出与粉笔和大理石相同的矿物制成的危险外观的刺。开式格子结构意味着材料坚固而不太重，而类似于用于建造飞机的金属泡沫。  
为了从这种坚硬、坚硬的矿物中形成有序的网络，这些生物显然是用柔软、柔软的膜制造出一个模子，然后结晶其中一个互穿网络中的硬材料。其他生物也可以按这种方式铸造有序的矿物泡沫，以达到更复杂的目的。由于光从图案化结构的元素中反弹，这种网格可以像镜子和管道一样限制和引导光。一种特殊的海洋蠕虫的甲壳质棘内的中空微通道的蜂窝排列，将这些毛发状的结构转变成天然的光纤，可以传导光，使生物根据疾病的方向由红色变成蓝绿色。赋值。这种颜色变化可能会阻止捕食者。

The principle of using soft tissues and membranes as molds for forming patterned mineral exoskeletons is widely used in the sea.  
Some sponges have exoskeletons made of bars of mineral linked like climbing frames, which look remarkably similar to the patterns formed by the edges and junctions of soap films in foam —no coincidence, if surface tension dictates the architecture.  
The formation of hard tissue, known as biomineralization, generates spectacular results in marine organisms called radiolarians and diatoms. Some of these have delicately patterned exoskeletons made from a mesh of mineral hexagons and pentagons: you might call them the honeycombs of the sea. When the German biologist (and talented artist) Ernst Haeckel first saw their shapes in a microscope in the late nineteenth century, he made them the star attraction of a portfolio of drawings called Art Forms in Nature, which were very influential among artists of the early twentieth century and still inspire admiration today. To Haeckel,they seemed to offer evidence of a fundamental creativity and artistry in the natural world—a preference for order and pattern built into the very laws of nature. Even if we don’t subscribe to that notion now, there’s something in Haeckel’s conviction that patterns are an irrepressible impulse of the natural world—one that we have every right to find beautiful.

用软组织和膜作为模板形成矿物外骨骼的原理在海洋中被广泛使用。  
有些海绵的外骨骼由类似攀登框架的矿物棒制成，看起来与泡沫中肥皂膜的边缘和接合点形成的图案非常相似，如果表面张力决定了建筑结构，那就不是巧合。  
硬组织的形成，被称为生物矿化，在被称为放射虫和硅藻的海洋生物中产生了惊人的结果。其中一些有精致的图案，由一个矿物六边形和五边形的网格构成：你可以称之为海洋的蜂窝。当德国生物学家（天才艺术家）艾伦斯特在十九世纪下旬在显微镜下第一次看到它们的形状时，他使它们成为自然界中艺术形式的组合的星体吸引物，这在二十世纪初和二十世纪的艺术家中是非常有影响的。直到今天才引起人们的钦佩。对海克尔来说，他们似乎提供了自然界中一种基本的创造性和艺术性的证据，偏爱于自然法则中的秩序和模式。即使我们现在不认同这一观点，海克尔坚信，模式是自然界的一种不可抑制的冲动，我们有权利去发现美丽。


FITTING IN  
A single layer or “raft” of bubbles contains mostly hexagonal bubbles, albeit not all of them perfect hexagons. There are some “defects”—bubbles with perhaps five or seven sides. Nonetheless, all the junctions of bubble walls are threefold, intersecting at angles that are close to 120˚.

拟合  
单层或“筏”的气泡主要包含六边形气泡，尽管并非全部都是完美六边形。有一些“缺陷”-气泡可能有五或七个方面。尽管如此，所有的气泡壁的交界处都是三倍的，在接近120°的角度相交。


FORCES AT WORK  
Bees seem to have evolved capabilities for making perfectly hexagonal cells from the soft wax that they secrete. However, some researchers believe that surface tension in the soft wax might be sufficient to pull the cells into shape, in much the same way as it organizes bubbles in a bubble raft.

蜜蜂似乎已经进化出能够从它们分泌的软蜡中制造出完美的六角形细胞的能力。然而，一些研究人员认为，软蜡中的表面张力可能足以将细胞拉成形状，就像在气泡筏中组织气泡一样。
