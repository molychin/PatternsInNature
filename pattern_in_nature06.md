PATTERNS IN NATURE
Convection can create order in frigid conditions, too. In the remote frozen wastes of Alaska and Scandinavia, you might come across stones seemingly arranged into patterns on the tundra by frost giants—ring-shaped mounds as tall as a person is high, or great pebbles disported in rows and stripe formations as though shepherded by a massive rake. Needless to say, no intelligent beings have carried out such a pointless feat of landscaping. The stones have been heaved into place by convection currents in water that freezes and thaws cyclically just beneath the ground surface.

自然界的模式
对流可以在寒冷条件下创造秩序，太。在遥远的阿拉斯加和斯堪的纳维亚的荒芜，你可能会遇到的
看似排列成图案的霜巨人的苔原石环形土墩作为一个人高高，或大鹅卵石嬉戏行和条纹形成仿佛带由一个巨大的耙。不用说，没有智能生物都进行这种毫无意义的壮举的美化。石头被扔进的地方在水的对流冻结和融化的循环就在地面上。

River’s edge
Fluid flow can become not just a patterned phenomenon but a patterning agent itself: the shapes and forms of the water leave permanent traces. Streams, rivers, and oceans pick up sand, silt, and stones and shift them in the current, and the resulting processes of erosion and deposition rearrange the landscape into patterns that are as pleasing as they are surprising. The meanders of a river are one of the best-known examples of how feedback processes create order and structure.

河边  
流体流动不仅可以是图案化现象，也可以是图案化剂本身：水的形状和形式留下永久痕迹。河流、河流和海洋吸收沙子、淤泥和石头，并将它们转移到水流中，由此产生的侵蚀和沉积过程将景观重新排列成令人惊讶的令人愉悦的模式。河流的蜿蜒曲折是反馈过程如何创造秩序和结构的最著名的例子之一。

Because the water flows faster on the outside edge of a meander, and slower on the inside, the river bank becomes more eroded on the outer bend while silt gets deposited on the inside. This means that bends, once they appear, bulge ever outward as though a bubble is being blown in the river’s course. Eventually the two sides of the loop meet and coalesce, and the bulge is pinched off into an ox-bow lake.

因为水流动速度对弯曲的外边缘，慢在里面，河岸变得更加侵蚀在外弯而淤泥沉积在里面。这意味着，一旦出现弯曲，向外凸出，就像一个泡沫是吹在河道。最终双方的环满足和融合，和凸起的夹断进入牛轭湖。

If sediment erosion and deposition are particularly strong, this restructuring creates a much more complex river form than a lone, meandering thread. Channels branch off, intersect, and reconnect, and the water’s course becomes a delicate, many-stranded braid in which there is a constant dialog between flow and stasis, between water and earth. We can see these patterns in the tapestry of shallow water running across the sand into the sea. The slightest impediment of pebble or shell sets up chevronlike shapes that overlap and interfere. One way or another, the river reaches the sea, flowing to the pattern of its own inexorable and beautiful logic.

如果泥沙冲淤都特别强，这一重组创造了一种比孤独更复杂的河流形态，蜿蜒的螺纹渠道分流，相交，并重新连接，和水的过程变得微妙，许多搁浅的辫子这是流动和停滞之间的不断对话，水和地球之间。我们可以看到这些图案的挂毯浅水跑过沙滩大海。卵石或外壳设置chevronlike形状重叠和干扰丝毫阻碍。一种或另一种方式，河水流入大海，流入自己的必然和美丽的逻辑模式。

TWISTS AND TURNS

BREAKING THE FLOW  
The wake of a floating leaf borne along with the flow of a river illustrates the regularity of this flow form, which echoes that of the leaf itself.

LOCUSTS,MADAGASCAR  
Some swarming creatures, such as these migratory locusts, don’t display quite such tightly orchestrated patterns as fish or birds, but nevertheless have a high degree of order in the direction and spacing of individuals that prevents collisions in the densely packed throng.

蝗虫，马达加斯加  
一些蜂拥而至的生物，如这些洄游蝗虫，没有显示出像鱼类或鸟类那样紧密协调的模式，但是在个体的方向和间距上有高度的有序性，以防止密集的人群中的碰撞。

STRENGTH IN NUMBERS

AIRFLOW TRAILS REVEALED BY CLOUDS  
These organized vortices form in the air above the ocean (as traced by clouds) when winds are disturbed by obstacles such as islands protruding from the water’s surface.  
Here, the flow patterns include mushroom-shaped “dipole” vortices and a tight succession of vortices alternating in direction, called a Kármán vortex street. Note that these flow structures can also form without the clouds, but they will not then be visible.  

云层气流轨迹   
这些组织的旋涡形成于海洋上方的空气中（如被云所追踪），当风被诸如海岛突起的障碍物干扰时。  
在这里，流动模式包括蘑菇形的“偶极子”旋涡和一系列紧密交替的涡旋，称为Ka RM弧形涡街。注意，这些流动结构也可以在没有云层的情况下形成，但是它们不会是可见的。


BENDING LAWS  
There’s a subtle logic to the forms of river meanders, which dictates that as the river channel gets narrower, the bends get tighter and their “wavelength” decreases. In other words, the ratio of river width to meander wavelength stays more or less the same.

弯曲规律  
河流蜿蜒的形式有一个微妙的逻辑，这意味着随着河道越来越窄，弯道变得越来越紧，它们的“波长”减小。换句话说，河流宽度与蜿蜒波长的比值大致保持不变。

RIPPLES AT THE BORDER  
When one stream of a fluid—air or water, say—passes past another at a different speed, the interface between the two can develop a wavy shape. The different flow speeds create a difference in pressure across the boundary, which can amplify any random ripple into a more pronounced wave. Eventually this wave can peak, crest,and break into a series of curlicue vortices, as seen here traced out by clouds in the atmosphere (1 and 2) and in computer simulations of flow (3and 4). The emergence of these wavy patterns is called a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, after the two scientists who explained it.

边境的涟漪  
当流体或水的一个流，例如以不同的速度通过另一个流时，两者之间的界面可以发展成波浪形。不同的流动速度在边界上产生压力差，可以将任何随机波纹放大为更明显的波。最终，该波可以达到峰值、波峰，并形成一系列曲线状涡旋，如图所示，由大气中的云（1和2）和流的计算机模拟（3和4）跟踪。在解释这两个科学家之后，这些波浪型的出现被称为Kelvin Helmholtz不稳定性。


THE POWER OF WAVES  
High-speed photographs of breaking waves capture the extraordinary elegance and coherence of the flow—a degree of organization normally all but invisible to the naked eye, but the kind of “deep order” that Leonardo da Vinci sought to intuit and illustrate.

波浪的力量  
破碎波的高速照片捕捉到了流动的非凡优雅和连贯性，这种组织的程度通常是肉眼看不见的，但达·芬奇寻求直觉和阐释的那种“深层秩序”。

SAND DUNES, BRAZIL

巴西沙丘  
巴西的Langoi-Malnhanes国家公园的沙丘呈波浪状，被捕获的水潭突出。在这里，在自组织模式中有一个优选的长度尺度，对应于波动的波长。


SAND PATTERNS  
The range of patterns that can stem from sand grains being eroded,carried, and rearranged by flowing water is immense. Some are braided, some branched or ridged, or shaped like fanning chevrons.
They depend on many factors—the speed and depth of the flow, say,or the cohesion of the sand grains, or how readily the slopes tumble in little avalanches.

砂纹  
由沙粒侵蚀、携带和重新排列的水流所形成的图案范围是巨大的。有的是辫状的，有的是分枝的，有的是脊状的，有的形状像扇形的雪佛龙。
它们取决于许多因素，比如水流的速度和深度，或者沙粒的内聚力，或者斜坡在小雪崩中的倾斜程度。

STONE CIRCLES  
So-called “patterned ground,” like the rings of stones seen here in the Norwegian tundra, is created by convection currents in the water that freezes and thaws underground over the seasonal cycle. Because water has the peculiar property of being denser a few degrees above freezing point than just before it freezes, water that thaws and warms close to the surface becomes denser than the almost-frozen water below, and it sinks. This produces convective circulation, which becomes organized into more or less regular “cells.” Stones in the ground are corralled by the circulation into subsurface clusters such as clumps or rings, which may then be brought to the surface by the well-known process of “frost heaving,” familiar to farmers (since it scatters their fields with stones), when the ground freezes. Sometimes the convection patterns produce stripes of stones rather than these rings.

石圈  
所谓“图案的地面，“就像在这里看到挪威苔原石环，是由水冻结和融化地下的季节循环对流产生的。因为水具有高几度冰点以上只是冻结之前的特有性质，水融化和温暖接近表面变得致密比几乎结冰的水下，它下沉。这就产生了对流循环，从而变得更多或更少的正常细胞”。“在地面上的石头被从循环到地下的集群如团块或环，然后可能引起“冻胀知名过程表面，“秘境懂得农民（因为它将自己的田地的石头），当地面结冰。有时对流模式产生条纹的石头，而不是这些环。

5 WAVES & DUNES  
How to make a chemical clock

5 波浪与沙丘  
如何制作化学钟

In a real sense, all of nature is waves. Light and sound are undulations, the oceans and the atmosphere support oscillations, and pulses of activity quicken the heart and the brain. Quantum physics tells us that the smallest particles of matter may act like waves in the right circumstances. The wave is a pattern in time as well as space: it is a constant pulse, a periodic coming and going.  
When one wave meets another, their interference can create spectacular new patterns. But perhaps most astonishing of all are waves that organize themselves from sheer disorder or from seemingly inexorable, one-way processes: from the chemical reactions between molecules moving at random,say, or the collisions of wind-blown sand. In such cases, waves can imprint themselves on matter with a flamboyant ebullience.

从本质上说，自然界的一切都是波浪。光和声音是波动的，海洋和大气支持振荡，活动的脉冲加速心脏和大脑。量子物理学告诉我们，在适当的情况下，最小的物质粒子可能像波一样作用。波是时间和空间的模式：它是一个恒定的脉冲，一个周期性的来来往往。  
当一个波与另一个波相遇时，它们的干涉可以创造出壮观的新模式。但也许最令人吃惊的是，这些波是从纯粹无序或看似不可阻挡的单向过程中组织出来的：来自随机移动的分子之间的化学反应，或者说是风沙的碰撞。在这种情况下，波浪可以以华丽的沸腾方式在物质上留下印迹。

1 CELLULAR SCROLLS  
The soil-dwelling slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum will, when stressed by lack of water or nutrients, aggregate into clumps of cells.  
This occurs as the cells emit regular pulses of a chemical attractant, which makes the colony organize itself into concentric and spiral wave forms like these.

土壤粘液盘基网柄菌在缺少水分或营养物时会聚集成细胞群。  
当细胞发出化学吸引物的规则脉冲时，这会使菌落组织成同心和螺旋波状。

2 and 3 CHLADNI FIGURES  
Waves are at the root of the patterns called Chladni figures, made by vibrating a flat plate onto which fine grains are scattered—for example, using sound waves.

2和3克拉德尼图形
波是被称为ChrdNi图形的根部，通过振动一个平板，用声波散射细颗粒。

The slime mold leads an undistinguished life. It lives in soil and rotting leaves, where it feeds on Dictyostelium discoideum bacteria. It exists as single-celled organisms visible only under a microscope: fifty of them head to toe would stretch for just a millimeter. But if these primitive cells find themselves short of nutrients,heat, or moisture, they do a remarkable thing.  
They become artists.  
That’s a bit of a fanciful way to put it, perhaps—but there’s no denying that the patterns formed by Dictyostelium cells under stress are beautiful. The colony organizes itself into ranks:  
lines of cells densely clustered, separated by more sparsely populated gaps. These ranks aren’t straight, but are curved into delicate spiral forms.  
As the cells march forth in regular array, the spirals spread outward like rippling waves, turning as they do so. Where two spiral waves meet, they destroy one another. The result is mesmerizing.

黏菌导致一种与众不同的生活。它生活在土壤和腐烂的叶子上，它在盘基网柄菌上觅食。它存在于单细胞有机体中，只有在显微镜下才能看到：它们的头到趾的五十只会延伸一毫米。但是，如果这些原始细胞缺乏营养、热量或水分，它们就做了一件了不起的事情。  
他们成为艺术家。  
这是一种奇怪的说法，但不可否认，网盘菌细胞在压力下形成的图案是美丽的。殖民地把自己组织成等级：  
细胞密集丛生，由较稀疏的间隙分隔。这些等级不是直的，而是弯曲成精致的螺旋形。  
当细胞以规则排列的方式前进时，螺旋状物向外传播，就像波纹波一样。在两个螺旋波相遇的地方，它们互相破坏。结果令人着迷。

This behavior can be regarded as the cells’ attempt to dance their way out of danger. The wave patterns are just the first stage in a process in which cells gradually crawl toward one another and clump together in a mound resembling a tiny slug. This mass of perhaps a hundred thousand cells starts to act like a single organism, wriggling its slimy way in search of water or warmth. Once it finds a better environment, it forms into a finger that stands upright, at the tip of which a bulbous, fruitlike shape balloons out that contains hardy spores in suspended animation, ready to germinate into new cells.
As survival mechanisms go, it’s impressive and inventive. But how do the cells manage such a collaborative feat? They do it by communicating chemically. Under stress, they start to emit a chemical compound that attracts other cells nearby, much as some animals emit pheromones to attract mates. But crucially, this chemical attractant is released in regular pulses, and it’s this rhythmic emission that creates the waves among the slime-mold population.

这种行为可以被视为细胞试图摆脱危险的尝试。波型只是一个过程中的第一个阶段，在这个过程中，细胞逐渐向另一个方向爬行，并聚集在一个类似小蛞蝓的土丘中。大概有十万个细胞的细胞开始像一个生物体一样，蠕动着它那黏糊糊的方式寻找水或温暖。一旦它找到了一个更好的环境，它就形成一个直立的手指，在它的顶端有一个球状的、果子状的球状气球，在悬挂的动画中含有顽强的孢子，准备发芽成新的细胞。  
随着生存机制的发展，它是令人印象深刻和创造性的。但是细胞如何管理这样的合作壮举呢？他们通过化学交流来做到这一点。在压力下，它们开始发射一种化合物，吸引附近的其他细胞，就像一些动物发出信息素来吸引配偶一样。但关键的是，这种化学引诱剂以规则的脉冲释放出来，正是这种有节奏的发射在黏菌种群中产生了波。

If that steady pulse reminds you of a heartbeat, so it should. With its coordinated waves of activity, the Dictyostelium colony is behaving like the cardiac cells of the heart, which generate regular pulses of electrical activity that enable the muscles to contract with a steady beat,pumping blood. The comparison is deeper than you might imagine, for the electrical waves of the heart can also take on a spiral formation. If they do, however, it’s bad news: this particular pattern of “heart-wave” activity signals the onset of rapid pulses, faster than the normal heartbeat, that may then break down into quite random, shallow muscular spasms, producing the life-threatening condition called atrial fibrillation. Spiral waves in Dictyostelium are a survival stategy; in the heart they can be fatal.  
Waves permeate all of nature—quite literally.

如果那个稳定的脉搏提醒你心跳，那么它应该是。盘基网柄菌群具有协调的活动波，其行为类似于心脏的心脏细胞，它产生规则的电活动脉冲，使肌肉与稳定的搏动收缩，抽血。这个比喻比你想象的要深刻，因为心脏的电波也可以螺旋形地形成。然而，如果他们这样做的话，这是个坏消息：这种“心波”活动的特定模式预示着快速脉搏的发作，比正常心跳快，然后可能分解成相当随机、浅层的肌肉痉挛，从而产生危及生命的状态，叫做心房颤动。盘基网柄菌中的螺旋波是一种生存策略；在心脏中，它们可能是致命的。  
波很自然地渗透到自然界的各个角落。

Sound waves are vibrations of the air, while light is a wave of oscillating electrical and magnetic fields, supporting one another as they advance through space faster than anything else.  
When they encounter one another, waves may “interfere.” Depending on whether they are in or out of step, their peaks and troughs might reinforce one another or cancel out, and the resulting interference patterns can be beautiful, as when water waves bounce off the edges of walls, bathtubs, and river banks. Interference of light waves gives rise to spectacular colors, like those of soap films or oil films on the surface of a wet road. When waves are confined within a fixed space, like sound waves in an organ pipe, certain frequencies and patterns may be picked out in the phenomenon of resonance. The eighteenthcentury scientist and musician Ernst Chladni discovered that resonances in a metal plate, when it is vibrated by drawing a violin bow across one edge, can usher fine grains scattered on the surface into ornate patterns that follow the nodes,where there is no up and down vibration.

声波是空气的振动，而光是一个振荡的电场和磁场的波，相互支持，因为它们比其他东西更快地推进空间。  
当它们相遇时，波浪可能会“干扰”，这取决于它们是否在台阶中，它们的波峰和波谷可能相互加强或抵消，由此产生的干涉图案可以是美丽的，就像水波从墙壁、浴缸的边缘反弹出来一样。河岸。光波的干涉会产生壮观的色彩，比如湿路面上的肥皂膜或油膜。当波被限制在一个固定的空间内，如器官管中的声波时，在共振现象中可以挑选出特定的频率和模式。18世纪的科学家和音乐家Ernst Chladni发现，金属板中的共振，当它通过拉一个小提琴弓在一个边缘上振动时，可以将细小的颗粒分散在表面上，形成一个遵循节点的华丽图案，在那里没有上下振动。


Chemical clocks  
But the waves of Dictyostelium and the heart are different from these. They are not vibrations in any real sense: nothing is “shaking” the slime mold or the heart tissue. The waves are self-organized: they spring right out of the medium that carries them.  
It’s as if a cup of coffee suddenly separated out into rotating spirals of cream in the dark liquid.  
If it seems unlikely to you that such things could happen, your intuition would be justified—but wrong. That’s exactly how chemists felt when,in the 1950s, spontaneous wave formation was discovered by a Soviet chemist in a mixture of apparently innocuous ingredients. Their discoverer,Boris Belousov, was accused of incompetence,because what he had found didn’t seem possible:

化学钟  
但盘基网柄菌和心脏的波动与这些不同。它们不是真正意义上的振动：没有任何东西在“振动”粘液或心脏组织。波浪是自组织的：它们从携带它们的介质中弹出。  
就像一杯咖啡突然在黑暗的液体中分离出来，变成螺旋状的奶油。  
如果你觉得这样的事情不可能发生，你的直觉是合理的，但却是错误的。在20世纪50年代，苏联化学家在一种看似无害的成分的混合物中发现了自发波的形成，这正是化学家们所感受到的。他们的发现者Boris Belousov被指控无能，因为他所发现的似乎不可能：

a chemical reaction that seemed to proceed spontaneously first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. In other words, it oscillated,as if time were swinging back and forth. In the 1960s a young Russian biochemist named Anatoly Zhabotinsky made some changes to Belousov’s recipe that switched the mixture, more strikingly,between red and blue. There was no denying it now: the reaction really did oscillate back and forth. This mixture has become known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.  
The oscillations don’t last forever. Left in a beaker, the reaction will, after a long time, eventually settle down into a single state and stay there. But you can keep the color changes going indefinitely if you keep feeding the mixture with fresh ingredients and flushing away the ones that have reacted—in other words, if you keep up an input of matter and energy, which can stop the reaction from reaching its final or “equilibrium” state. The oscillations are a non-equilibrium phenomenon. This is a common feature of many of the pattern-forming processes in nature: they are far from their equilibrium state, kept there by a constant influx of energy. The perpetual repetitive circulating motions of the oceans, for example, are driven by the heat of the sun.  
一种化学反应，似乎首先自发地在一个方向上进行，然后在相反的方向上进行。换句话说，它摆动着，好像时间在来回摆动。20世纪60年代，一位名叫Anatoly Zhabotinsky的年轻俄罗斯生物化学家对Belousov的配方做了一些改变，使混合物更加醒目地在红和蓝之间转换。现在不可否认：反应确实来回振荡。这种混合物已被称为Belousov Zhabotinsky（BZ）反应。  
振荡不会永远持续下去。留在烧杯里，反应很长一段时间后，最终会落入一个单一的状态，留在那里。但是，如果你继续用新鲜的原料喂养混合物，并把那些已经反应的物质冲走，换句话说，如果你保持物质和能量的输入，这可以阻止反应达到最终或“平衡”状态，你可以保持颜色变化无限期地进行下去。振荡是一种非平衡现象。这是自然界许多模式形成过程的共同特征：它们远离它们的平衡状态，通过能量的不断涌入保持在那里。例如，海洋的永久重复循环运动是由太阳的热量驱动的。

In 1910, an Austrian-American ecologist named Alfred Lotka described a theory of oscillating chemical reactions in which he showed that a combination of particular reactions between the different ingredients can lead to a seesawing alternation between different states.  
In one state one ingredient is present at a high concentration, so the mixture might be one color; in the other state a different reagent might dominate, producing a different color.  
Lotka wasn’t, in fact, particularly interested in chemistry. As an ecologist he was trying to understand animal populations—he was just using chemical reactions as an analogy. Imagine a population of rabbits preyed on by a population of foxes. Rabbits are noted for their ability to replicate, and the more of them there are, the more they breed. This can lead to a population explosion. If rabbits were molecules, they would be called auto-catalysts. A catalyst is a molecule that speeds up the rate at which a reaction happens: an auto-catalyst is one that speeds up the rate of its own production. Auto-catalysis is a positive feedback process: it can produce a runaway effect, blowing up out of control.

1910，一位名叫Alfred Lotka的奥地利裔生态学家描述了一种振荡化学反应的理论，在这一理论中，他显示了不同成分之间的特定反应的组合可以导致不同状态之间的跷跷板交替。  
在一种状态下，一种成分以高浓度存在，因此混合物可能是一种颜色；在另一种状态下，不同的试剂可能是一种颜色。  
主宰，产生不同的颜色。  
事实上，洛特卡对化学特别感兴趣。作为生态学家，他试图了解动物种群，他只是用化学反应作为类比。想象一下一群狐狸捕食的兔子。兔子以其复制能力而著称，它们的数量越多，繁殖就越多。这可能导致人口爆炸。如果兔子是分子，它们将被称为自动催化剂。催化剂是一种加速反应速率的分子：自动催化剂是加速自身生产速率的催化剂。自动催化是一个正反馈过程：它可以产生失控的效应，失控。

Unchecked, the rabbit population will grow until it has consumed all the food (grass), and then it crashes to extinction.
But the foxes keep this runaway process in check. The more rabbits there are, the more the foxes thrive by eating them. It’s a delicate balance.  
If the foxes are too ravenous, they will eat all the rabbits; then they will starve.  
Alternatively, the ecosystem might develop an oscillating state. The foxes eat so many rabbits that there’s little prey left, and the fox population declines. This gives some respite to the remaining rabbits, and their population grows. That creates an abundance of prey for the surviving foxes, and their numbers grow until they have overwhelmed the rabbits and they go into decline again through lack of food… and so on. At one point in the cycle, there are plenty of rabbits but few foxes; at another point, the reverse is true.

未经检查，兔子的数量将增长，直到它消耗了所有的食物（草），然后它崩溃到灭绝。  
但狐狸保持这种失控的过程检查。兔子越多，狐狸吃的越多。这是一种微妙的平衡。  
如果狐狸太贪婪，他们会吃掉所有的兔子，然后它们就会饿死。  
或者，生态系统可能发展为振荡状态。狐狸吃了这么多兔子，剩下的猎物很少，狐狸数量减少了。这给剩下的兔子一些喘息的机会，它们的种群也在增长。这就为幸存的狐狸创造了大量的猎物，它们的数量不断增长，直到它们战胜了兔子，它们由于缺乏食物而再次衰败……等等。在周期的某一点，有很多兔子，但狐狸很少；另一方面，反过来是正确的。

This was basically the scheme devised by Lotka, although he expressed it in terms of chemicals that are auto-catalytic or react with and “consume” other chemicals. Several decades later it was pointed out that in a chemical mixture in which the ingredients aren’t perfectly mixed so that their concentration is the same everywhere,the oscillations depend on two things: how fast the molecules react (which consumes them) and how fast they move by random diffusion from place to place (which replenishes the ingredients).  
Because of the two competing processes, these are called reaction-diffusion systems.

这基本上是由Lotka发明的方案，尽管他用化学催化的方式来表达，这些化学物质是自动催化或与其他化学物质“消耗”。几十年后，人们指出，在一种化学混合物中，成分不完全混合，以致它们的浓度在每一个地方都是相同的，振荡取决于两个因素：分子的反应速度（消耗它们）和它们通过随机扩散运动的速度。从一个地方到另一个地方（补充成分）。  
由于这两个相互竞争的过程，这些被称为反应扩散系统。


1 BRANCHING OUT  
The cells of slime molds often gather together into a mass called a plasmodium, which can take on complex shapes because of the chemical signals that the cells exchange. This is a plasmodium of the mold Fuligo septica, sometimes called scrambled egg slime.

粘液细胞通常聚集在一起，称为疟原虫，由于细胞交换的化学信号，它可以形成复杂的形状。这是败酱草霉菌的疟原虫，有时称为炒鸡蛋泥。


2 LIESEGANG ROCKS  
These patterns are not lichen growing on the rocks, but are part of the rock itself.

They are created by a wavelike crystallization process when the rock is formed—notice how the wave fronts annihilate one another when they intersect. These structures are called Liesegang rings, after the German scientist who first identified the pulsating precipitation phenomenon.

2列塞岗岩体  
这些图案不是在岩石上生长的地衣，而是岩石本身的一部分。  
当岩石形成时，它们是由波浪状的结晶过程创造的，注意波阵面在相交时如何相互湮灭。这些结构被称为列涩刚环，在德国科学家首次发现脉动降水现象之后。


CORRUGATED DESERTS  
Wind arranges sand grains into regular structures such as these parallel ripples.  
They are self-organized patterns arising from the amplification of small random bumps —a process that can only proceed when one bump is a certain minimum distance from the preceding one. As a result, the ripples have a preferred wavelength, picked out by the particulars of the wind speed and the average grain size.

“Waves permeate all of nature—quite literally.”  
波纹荒漠  
风将沙粒排列成规则结构，如这些平行波纹。  
它们是由小随机凸点的放大所产生的自组织模式，该过程只能在一个凸起与先前的一个凸起之间存在一定的最小距离时才进行。因此，纹波有一个优选的波长，由风速的细节和平均晶粒尺寸挑选出来。  
“波很自然地渗透到自然界。”
