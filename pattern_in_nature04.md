MANDELBROT SET  
Purely mathematical fractals can be generated by equations that pick out numbers in the two-dimensional plane: ordinary (real) numbers supply one axis (east–west), and “imaginary numbers” containing the square root of -1 are arrayed along the other (north–south). Numbers containing both real and imaginary parts occupy the plane beyond these two axes.
Shown here are fragments of the so-called Mandelbrot set at different scales of magnification.

It is traced out by an equation that takes one number and transforms it into another, which is then “fed back” into the equation in an iterative process.

Repeating this process again and again produces numbers that either stay finite or grow to become infinite. The Mandelbrot set, shown in black, is the space occupied by numbers that do not grow to infinity when subjected to this iteration. This space has an intricate structure that repeats at different scales. Coloring the rest of the space according to the rate at which the respective numbers grow to infinity reveals yet more fractal structure, producing these baroque spirals.

COSMIC FRACTALS
Turbulent flow is a fractal form in which energy is channeled down to ever finer scales, generating increasingly small structures in the process. The resulting forms can be chaotic—it’s impossible to predict exactly what they will look like or how they will evolve over time—but nonetheless they have a mathematical fractal structure that represents a kind of “hidden order.” The richness of shape and form that results is apparent in these views of the turbulent clouds of gas and dust in the Orion nebula (left) and the Tarantula nebula (see pages 76–77).

3 SPIRALS  
The math in snails and sunflowers

3螺旋  
蜗牛和向日葵的数学


We see spirals everywhere in nature, from the sea snail’s shell to the swirling gas and stars of a spiral galaxy. But do they share anything in common? On the whole, they do. Most natural spirals have a shape called logarithmic, which means that, like fractals, a small part looks just like a bigger part. A snail shell grown in such a form can stay the same shape as it gets ever bigger. Such spirals may also appear in less obvious places; the circular arrangement of florets in the head of a sunflower is made up of two sets of logarithmic spirals rotating in opposite directions. And spiral vortices form in flowing fluids, from bath water disappearing down the plughole to cyclonic storms on Earth and Jupiter. This is one of nature’s universal designs.

自然界中到处可见螺旋，从蜗牛壳到漩涡气体和螺旋星系的恒星。但是他们有什么共同点吗？总的说来，他们是这样做的。大多数的自然螺旋有一个叫做对数的形状，这意味着，像分形一样，一小部分看起来就像一个更大的部分。蜗牛壳以这样的形式生长可以保持和它越来越大的形状一样。这种螺旋也可能出现在不太明显的地方；向日葵头上的小花的圆形排列由两组相反方向旋转的对数螺旋构成。漩涡在流动的流体中形成，从沐浴水消失到塞子洞到地球和Jupiter的旋风风暴。这是大自然的普遍设计之一。

What makes spirals so special that they recur at scales from tiny to cosmic? Do these forms really share commonalities, or are their parallels just coincidental?  
Many natural spirals, like that of a snail shell, are not just any old scrolling shape. They begin with graceful, almost languid curves, but become increasingly tightly coiled as we move in toward the center. This is different from the kind of spiral made by rolling up a garden hose. In that case,the width of the coils remains the same on every turn. This is a vital distinction.

是什么让他们如此特殊的螺旋复发在尺度小宇宙吗？做这些形式真正平等分享，或是它们的相似只是巧合吗？  
许多天然的螺旋，就像一个蜗牛的壳，不只是任何旧的滚动的形状。他们开始用优美，几乎无力的曲线，但越来越紧密盘绕我们移向中心。这是不同于螺旋由卷起花园软管类。在这种情况下，线圈的宽度保持每转一。这是至关重要的区别。

The coiled-hose spiral is called an Archimedean spiral, because Archimedes described it in the third century BCE in his book On Spirals. When it appears in the physical world, that’s generally because it does indeed come from rolling up some long or flat object with a constant width: a rope, a sheet of paper or a carpet, a worm. The snail shell, meanwhile, has a form called the logarithmic spiral, because one way of writing the mathematical equation that describes it involves logarithms. This spiral has a very special property: its shape remains the same no matter how small or big it is. It is another example of a self-similar pattern.

What does self-similarity mean here? Isn’t a spiral always a spiral shape anyway? Yes, it is—but there are distinctions. For one thing, an Archimedean spiral can only get so small and no smaller. When the radius of the coil is the same as its width, you’re at the limit: you can’t coil a rope more tightly than this. But as the logarithmic spiral rotates into its center, the coils go right on getting narrower and narrower, so the curvature can get tighter and tighter. You could say that the decreasing width keeps perfect pace with the greater curvature, so that the spiraling knows no limit.

螺旋管螺旋称为阿基米德螺旋，因为阿基米德描述了他在书中对螺旋的公元前三世纪。当它出现在物质世界中，这通常是因为它确实来自卷起一些长或扁平的物体具有恒定的宽度：一根绳子，一张纸或一个地毯，蠕虫。蜗牛的壳，同时，有一种称为对数螺旋线，因为它涉及到文字描述的数学方程，对数的方法之一。这种螺旋具有非常特殊的性质：它的形状保持不变，无论多么大或小。这是自相似模式的另一个例子。  
自我相似在这里意味着什么？螺旋不是螺旋形的吗？是的，但也有区别。首先，阿基米德螺旋只能得到这么小不小。当线圈的半径宽一样，你在限制：你不能比这更紧卷绳子。但为对数螺旋旋转进入中心，线圈就越走越窄，所以曲率可以紧。你可以说，宽度减小，与更大的曲率保持完美的步伐，使螺旋没有限度。

Another way of saying this is that the spiral looks the same no matter what scale you see it on. Zoom into the center of a snail shell and the curve looks just the same as it did before. In principle, a logarithmic spiral can go on curling inward or outward forever and its form would never change.  
This self-similarity is just what a gastropod mollusk like a snail needs. As the organism grows, it needs a bigger shell. But the shell is made of hard stuff—calcium carbonate, the same mineral as chalk and marble. It can’t expand, and it would be terribly tough on the snail to be forever taking the shell apart to build a new one. So mollusks simply adds an extension, growing a larger house out from the rim of the previous one.  
The early part of the shell, now too narrow, is simply abandoned.

另一种说法是，不管你看到什么样的尺度，螺旋看起来都是一样的。放大到蜗牛壳的中心，曲线看起来和以前一样。原则上，对数螺旋可以继续向内或向外卷曲，其形状永远不变。  
这种自相似性就像腹足类软体动物一样需要蜗牛。随着生物体的生长，它需要一个更大的外壳。但外壳采用硬东西碳酸钙，矿物为粉笔和大理石一样。它不能扩大，这将是非常艰难的蜗牛永远以壳分开，建立一个新的。所以软体动物只是增加了一个扩展，越来越多的大房子从以前的边缘。  
壳的早期部分，现在太窄了，简直是被遗弃的。

Such gradual widening of the rim could produce a cone, and that’s certainly one option for the creature. But to avoid carrying an ever lengthening burden, the cone is curled up compactly into a spiral, and this is more or less what a logarithmic spiral shell is: a sort of rolled-up cone.  
So the logarithmic spiral is a great design for a gastropod. It doesn’t “know” this, however. All it needs to heed is a growth rule that says “keep the shape of the rim the same, but increase its circumference at a steady rate.” To make the cone curl neatly into a logarithmic spiral, just add the condition that the rate of growth is faster on one side of the rim than the other: the cone will then spiral automatically. This simple principle is sufficient to construct a vast range of different shell shapes, like those seen in different species of marine gastropods, just by varying the perimeter of the mouth of the shell.

这种逐渐扩大的边缘会产生一个圆锥体，这当然是生物的一个选择。但是为了避免负担过长的负担，圆锥体被紧凑地卷成螺旋状，这或多或少是对数螺旋壳：一种卷起的圆锥体。  
对数螺线是腹足类的一个好的设计。然而，它并不“知道”这一点。它需要注意的是一个生长规律，它说“保持轮辋的形状相同，但以稳定的速度增加它的周长”。为了使圆锥卷曲成一个对数螺旋线，只需添加一个条件，即在轮辋一侧的生长速度比另一个圆锥体更快。然后会自动旋转。这个简单的原理就足以构造一个不同的贝壳形状，就像在不同种类的海生腹足中所看到的那样，只是通过改变壳口的周长。

This prescription for growing logarithmic spirals isn’t just followed by mollusks. These pleasing forms are also found in the convolutions of animal horns, talons, and claws, although there the spirals sometimes might not even complete a single full revolution.  
Spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way often (but not always) have a logarithmic shape, at least roughly. So do cyclones, tornadoes, whirlpools, and plughole vortices. Not all vortices in fluids fit this shape, but it is a common outcome of the way fluids circulate, especially if there is a “sink” at the center, like a plughole that is removing the fluid. Why do fluids seem so readily to coordinate their movements into this tightly organized path?

这种生长对数螺旋的处方不仅仅是软体动物。这些令人愉悦的形式也存在于动物角、爪和爪的卷曲中，尽管螺旋有时甚至不可能完成一次完整的旋转。
螺旋星系如银河系通常（但不总是）有对数形状，至少粗略地。旋风、龙卷风、漩涡和螺旋桨漩涡也是如此。不是所有流体中的漩涡都符合这种形状，但它是流体循环的常见结果，特别是如果在中心有一个“汇”，就像一个移除流体的塞子。为什么看起来那么容易流体的协调动作，为这个组织严密的路径？

The organization comes from the drag that one part of a moving fluid exerts on the other parts nearby—the same force that creates eddies and wakes as a coffee spoon stirs in the cream. These mutual influences of one flow driving another give rise to feedback that can marshal small, random disturbances into coherent large-scale movements.  
The gigantic vortices of cyclones rotate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The preference is caused by the rotation of the Earth, a phenomenon called the Coriolis effect. Some scientists have asserted that, if you take care to let all the initial randomness in a tank of water settle down, the very small influence of the Coriolis effect creates a detectable bias in a bathtub vortex, too. But it’s not clear if this is true—the experiment is very hard to do.

这个组织来自拖曳，一个流动的流体的一部分在同一个力作用在其他部分附近，当咖啡勺在奶油中搅动时，它产生漩涡和尾迹。一个流驱动另一个流的相互影响会产生反馈，这些反馈可以将小的、随机的干扰安排成连贯的大规模运动。  
旋涡的巨大旋涡在北半球逆时针旋转，在南半球呈顺时针方向旋转。偏好是由地球的旋转引起的，这种现象被称为科里奥利效应。一些科学家已经断言，如果你小心地让水槽中的所有初始随机性稳定下来，科里奥利效应的极小影响也会在浴缸漩涡中产生可检测的偏差。但目前还不清楚这是否是真的，实验是很难做到的。

“What makes spirals so special that they recur at scales from the tiny to the cosmic?”

“是什么让他们如此特别spirals recur在宇宙尺度小到酒店？“

The secret life of plants  
Of all the patterns and forms of nature, the spiral has probably held the greatest appeal for mystics and dreamers. It is revered by adherents of “sacred geometry,” who consider the patterns and forms of nature to embody spiritual truths of the cosmos. Spirals are found in ancient and indigenous art ranging from the carvings on the Bronze Age stones of Newgrange in Ireland to the paintings of Australian Aborigines.

植物的秘密生命  
自然界的各种图案和形状，螺旋有可能举行的神秘主义者和梦想家的吸引力最大。它是被“神圣几何学的拥护者，他认为“自然的形式来体现对宇宙真理的精神。螺旋是古代和土著艺术从青铜时代石纽格兰奇爱尔兰到澳大利亚土著绘画雕刻的发现。

Nothing better exemplifies the apparent mystery and profundity of the logarithmic spiral than its manifestation on the heads of flowers such as sunflowers and daisies. The seeds of a sunflower head are arrayed in rows that trace out not just a single logarithmic spiral but two entire sets of them, rotating in opposite directions. The pattern that results has profound mathematical beauty: crystalline precision combined with organic dynamism, creating shapes that seem almost to shift as you stare at them. The same double-spiral form can be seen in other plants:  
in the leaflets of a pine cone (most easily seen by looking down at the base), the leaves twisting along the branches of a monkey-puzzle tree, the segments on the skin of a pineapple, and the florets of a Romanesco cauliflower head. All these arrangements are examples of so-called phyllotaxis, which literally means “leaf motion.” If you count the numbers of spirals in each set, you find that they only take certain values.

没有更好的体现了明显的神秘和对数螺旋线的深度比花如向日葵、雏菊的头表现。一、向日葵种子排列成行，描绘出不只是一个单一的对数螺线，但其中两全套，在相反的方向旋转。结果，有着深刻的数学美的形式：结晶精密结合有机活力，创造的形状，仿佛把你盯着他们。在其他植物中也可以看到相同的双螺旋形状：  
在松果的传单（由俯视基地最容易看到），叶片扭曲沿着一个猴谜树枝头，在菠萝皮的部分，和一个罗马花椰菜小花。所有这些安排是所谓叶序的例子，它的字面意思是“叶运动”。如果算上螺旋的数量在每一组中，你发现他们只需要一定的价值。

For pine cones, these special pairings are generally 3/5, 5/8, or 8/13. For smaller sunflowers there might be 21 spirals in one direction, 34 in the other. For very large heads, there might be as many as 144 and 233. But only these pairs of numbers—never, say, 22 and 35. Why are some of these numbers favored over others?  
Each of these pairs corresponds to two adjacent numbers in a sequence in which each number is the sum of the previous two. If we start the sequence from the smallest pairing possible (0 and 1), then it runs like this:  
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, …

Because this sequence was first written down in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, it is called the Fibonacci series. The ratio of two successive terms in the series gets ever closer to a constant value as the numbers get larger: a number called the Golden Mean, roughly 1.618.  

cones for Special pairings松，these are generally 3／5 5 / 8或8月13日。For Smaller SUNFCCC，there might be 21 spills in one direction，34 in the other .为非常严重的Heads，There might be many as 144 and 233 .But only these pairs of numbers - no，say 22 and 35 .为什么这些数字有助于其他人？
在这方面，委员会注意到，根据《公约》第四条第1款（a）项的规定，《公约》第二条第二款（a）项和（b）项所述的任何其他措施均应符合《公约》的规定。If we start the sequence from the smallest可能保留（0和1），那是一个像这样的：
0，1，1，2，3，5，8，13，21，34、55、89、144、233……  
因为这是第一个序列written down in 1202 by the Italian mathematician Leonardo of比萨，known as it is called the斐波那契数列的系列。the ratio of terms in the two连续系列ever closer to得到恒定的值：get larger as the numbers number called the中庸之道，roughly 1.618。

No one is yet sure why the sunflower seeds adopt this arithmetical arrangement. One long standing idea is that it enables the florets or seeds or leaves to pack most efficiently as they bud from the tip of the growing stem. In other words, a new bud appears only when it can find enough space to do so. This is simply a geometric problem: if you want to arrange objects in an array spiraling out from a central source, what should be the angle between one object and the next? It turns out that the most efficient packing, which gives the double-spiral Fibonacci pattern of phyllotaxis, is one for which this angle is about 137.5˚—known as the Golden Angle.

That’s not the whole explanation, however. For one thing, how do plants “measure” where the next bud should go? The Fibonacci sequence and the packing idea describe how sunflower heads are arranged, but don’t explain how they achieve this arrangement. One possible explanation is that biochemical processes involving the growth hormone that triggers bud formation create what is in effect a kind of repulsive force between one bud and the next, so that the angle between them and the spiral center can’t be less than the Golden Angle.

现在还没有人知道为什么葵花籽采用算术的安排。一个长期存在的想法是，它使花或种子或树叶包最有效地为他们的芽从日益增长的茎尖。换句话说，一个新的花蕾出现时才可以找到足够的空间来做。这是一个简单的几何问题：如果你想安排对象数组中不断从一个源头，什么应该是一个对象和下一个之间的角度？事实证明，最有效的包装，这给叶序双螺旋布局模式，是指这个角度约为137.5˚-被称为黄金角。  
然而，这并不是全部的解释。一方面，植物如何“测量”下芽应该去吗？斐波那契数列和包装理念描述向日葵头设置，但没有解释他们是如何实现这一安排。一个可能的解释是，生化过程涉及生长激素触发效果一芽芽的形成创造和未来之间的一种排斥力是什么，所以他们和螺旋中心不应小于黄金角之间的角度。

An alternative theory is that the “force” that keeps buds a certain distance apart, marshaling them into the spiraling arrangements, is not chemical (caused by hormones) but mechanical:  
it comes from wrinkling and buckling of the soft tissue at the tip of the stem. At the very top of the stem, the “skin” is soft and flexible, but it gets tougher and stiffer further down the stem. The way the stem grows will compress the stiffer fabric near the tip and make it buckle. Perhaps new buds will then sprout from the crests of these wrinkles. Calculations of what this buckling looks like show that the patterns may resemble either Fibonacci spirals—little whorls of peaks around the stem’s center—or concentric, symmetrical folds on each side of the plant in alternating directions, first north–south, then east–west, and so on. That, too, is a pattern found in phyllotaxis.  

另一种理论认为，使芽保持一定距离分开的“力”使它们进入螺旋排列，不是化学（由荷尔蒙引起的）而是机械的：  
它来自于茎尖处的软组织皱褶和屈曲。在茎的顶端，“皮肤”柔软而有弹性，但在茎下更硬，更硬。茎生长的方式会压缩尖端附近的较硬的织物并使其屈曲。也许新的芽会从这些皱纹的顶部发芽。这种屈曲像表明，模式可能类似于斐波纳契数列螺旋小轮生在茎的中心或同心峰计算，对称褶皱在交替方向的植物每边，第一–南北东西，然后–，等等。这也是叶序中的一种模式。

The buckling model looks particularly appealing for explaining some of the bud arrangements in cacti, where the stubby, spiraling protrusions look more like wrinkles in hard skin. This concertinalike folding makes it easy for the soft tissues inside to swell quickly when there is water to absorb. Regular pleats and grooves are quite common on the tough outer skins of pulpy fruits such as pumpkins and gourds. These, too, may be patterns self-organized by the stresses that develop in the skin as the fruits grow and swell.  
Wrinkle patterns at the tips of our fingers can develop into spirallike concentric whorls. Because the wrinkles of fingerprints all have more or less the same width, the whorls aren’t logarithmic spirals, but more like the coil-of-rope Archimedean spiral. The buckling here seems to be caused by different layers of skin growing at different rates during early fetal development. Fingerprint whorls tend to be centered on the pads of your fingertips, where the curvature of the surface is greatest.  
But the details of the folds are determined rather randomly, and so your exact fingerprint pattern is unique. That’s so often how it is with natural patterns: they are endless variations on a theme.

屈曲模型看起来特别吸引人解释仙人掌中的一些芽排列，其中粗壮的螺旋状突起看起来更像硬皮中的皱纹。这种紧密的折叠使内部的软组织很容易在水吸收时迅速膨胀。普通的褶皱和沟槽在南瓜、葫芦等果肉坚韧的外皮上很常见。这些，也可能是自组织的发展模式，在皮肤的果实生长和膨胀应力。  
皱纹的模式在我们的指尖可以发展成螺形同心轮。因为指纹皱纹都有或多或少相同的宽度，此时不对数螺旋，但更像绳子阿基米德螺旋线圈。扣在这里似乎是由皮肤生长速率不同，在胎儿发育早期不同层引起的。指纹纹往往集中在你的指尖垫表面的曲率最大的。  
但褶皱细节确定而随机的，所以你的精确的指纹图谱是独一无二的。这常常是如何与自然模式：他们是一个主题的无限变化。

DOWN THE PLUGHOLE  
Vortex flows range in scale from the mundane spiraling of bath water as it drains to the terrifying gyrations of tornadoes and hurricanes. As a fluid flows inward toward a central core, the slightest deviation from perfect circular symmetry (which could happen at random) may be amplified because of the friction that makes one part of the flow influence another. Gradually, rotation becomes organized into a single coherent vortex. This is an example of spontaneous symmetry-breaking: the rotation transforms circular symmetry into an asymmetric twist, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

4 FLOW & CHAOS
Finding the hidden order
4流与混沌
寻找隐藏的秩序



The universe is dynamic—always on the move. From clouds of gas and dust, stars coalesce. Water circulates around the ocean in great loops and gyres,driven by differences in temperature and saltiness; convection currents stir the air and summon up clouds and jet streams. Rivers flow down from the mountains in branching formations like those through which our blood courses. Many of these flows are turbulent—too fast to maintain any constant form or to be fully predictable—and yet that doesn’t strip them of all order.
The fundamental forms of fluid flow, such as the whirlpool vortex, are as familiar in coffee and cream as they are in a tropical cyclone; a storm in a cup, indeed. In these and other ways, patterns of flow surround us with mystery and majesty.
宇宙总是动态的。从气体和尘埃的云层中，恒星凝聚起来。水在海洋中以巨大的回路和环流循环，由温度和咸度的差异驱动；对流气流搅动空气并召唤云和急流。河流从山里流下来，就像我们血液流过的分支一样。这些流中的许多湍流太快以至于不能保持任何恒定的形式或完全可预测，但这并不能使它们全部有序。
流体流动的基本形式，如惠而浦的旋涡，在咖啡和奶油作为他们在热带气旋一样熟悉；在杯中风暴，事实上。在这些和其他方式，流动模式围绕着我们，神秘而威严。

Rivers have always attracted artists. In China, poets of the Tang Dynasty sat contemplating them for days, while painters tried to capture the characteristic flow forms of the water in fluid brush strokes, alive with the vital energy they called qi. They were doubtless tantalized by the same thing that captivated Leonardo da Vinci when he sketched many images of flowing water in fifteenth-century Italy—the perception that amid the turbulent flow there is a kind of organization, a hint of patterns forever shifting and disintegrating. Leonardo intuited what scientists now recognize: turbulent water is not mere chaos, but a mesmerizing mixture of order and disorder. Leonardo’s intricate drawings of flow testify to his powers of observation, but there is something a little too regular about them that doesn’t quite match what we see. It is as if Leonardo felt that, in order to grasp the flow forms, he had to edit what he saw, making it more tangible and familiar. His images are what art historian Martin Kemp called structural intuitions. Through such intuitions, Kemp suggests, we try to make sense of the world we perceive. They guide us toward similarities and correspondences in the patterns of nature.

捕获的流体的笔触的水流量特性的形式，充满生命能量的他们所谓的气。他们无疑是吸引了，迷住了达·芬奇时，他画了许多的流水意象十五世纪意大利的感知，在湍流有一种组织一样，淡淡的图案永远的转变和崩解。列奥纳多凭直觉就知道什么科学家现在认识到：湍水不仅仅是混沌的，但一个迷人的混合物的有序与无序。列奥纳多的流动复杂的图纸，证明他的观察能力，但有一点太普通人，并不完全符合我们所看到的。这是因为如果列奥纳多觉得，为了掌握流动形式，他编辑他所看到的东西，使它更加有形的和熟悉的。他的作品是艺术历史学家马亭坎普称为结构的直觉。通过这样的直觉，Kemp认为，我们试图让我们感知到的世界意义。他们引导我们走向大自然的模式的相似性和对应。

There really is a kind of order in flow, but to see it more clearly, we need to slow the flow down. Most flows in nature are turbulent: they are so swift that all that remains of this order are glimpses, mesmerizing because of their very transience. If, however, we look at much gentler flows, the patterns are obvious—and stunning.
Think of water coursing down a long, shallow channel with smooth, flat sides. If the water’s speed is low—if it descends a very gentle gradient, say—then the flow follows more or less straight paths, as you can see by placing visible objects within it, such as a scattering of fine powder or blobs of colored ink. The water moves in flat,parallel layers, a type of flow called laminar.
Now imagine an obstacle in the flow—a dangling branch dips into the river, a boulder on the river bed pokes up through the surface.
真的是一种为了在流，但看的更清楚，我们需要慢慢的流下来。大多数的自然流动的湍流：他们是如此的快，所有的这种秩序仍然是迷人的一瞥，因为他们非常短暂。如果，然而，我们看看更温和的流动模式是显而易见的，惊人的。
认为水流过长，光滑的浅沟，平边。如果它是一个很温柔的梯度水的速度是低的，然后说流量或多或少遵循直线路径，你可以看到在它的可视对象，如散射细粉或一团彩色墨水。在平面，平行层水动，一种流动称为层流。
现在想象在圆晃来晃去的分支入河的一个障碍，在河床上boulder戳通过表面。


FOOTSTEPS IN THE FLOW
As a water strider paces across the surface of water, held up by surface tension, it leaves an ornate wake behind it, each step dragging the water into pairs of oppositely rotating vortices that evolve with baroque elegance (revealed here with blue dye).
流动中的脚步声
作为一个水上行走的步伐在水的表面，利用表面张力举行，它留下一个华丽的身后，每一步将水变成相对旋转的涡流，形成对巴洛克优雅（蓝色染料来显示）。

2 and 3 STUDIES OF FLOWING WATER
Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches of flowing water came from many hours of careful observation, and show the artist’s determination to discover the “essential forms” behind the superficial appearance of disorder.
流动水的2和3研究
达·芬奇的小品流水来自许多小时的仔细观察，表现出艺术家的发现“基本形式”的表象背后，测定障碍。



How does it disturb the smooth laminar flow?
That depends on several things: the size of the obstacle, the viscosity of the liquid (water and syrup respond differently), and in particular the speed of the flow. If it is slow enough, the fluid may pass gently around the obstacle and come together again on the far side, so that the paths revealed by the tracer material—the powder or ink—are smoothly bent to either side before
becoming parallel again. But if the flow is a little faster, a pair of spinning eddies appears in the wake behind the obstacle. Faster still, and the wake develops a persistent wavy undulation. As the flow speed increases, these waves grow and acquire crests that “break” and curl over, twisting into a regular train of vortices that turn first one way and then the other.
它是如何影响平滑层流？
这取决于几个方面：障碍物的大小、液体的粘度（水和糖浆的反应不同），并在特定的流动速度。如果它足够慢，流体可以通过轻轻地绕过障碍，再次走到一起，在另一边，这样通过示踪材料粉末或墨水显示路径平滑地弯曲一侧前
再次平行。但如果流动快一点，一对旋转的漩涡出现在障碍物后面的尾。速度更快，和唤醒的发展持续的波状起伏。随着流速的增加，这些波的波峰，成长和获得“打破”和卷曲，扭曲成一个定期列车的涡流，把第一个方法然后其他。

This baroque pattern is known as a Kármán vortex street. The vortices spring from the sides of the obstacle itself, as the fluid flowing past is dragged inward by friction and begins to turn on itself. Vortex streets are common in the natural world. They can be seen in cloud formations as air streams past some disrupting influence such as a region of high pressure. They spring from
the moving feet of a water strider propped up by surface tension on a pond surface, and they are shed by the flapping wings of insects, which cleverly maneuver the wings so as to harvest a little push from the eddies to give them extra lift.
这baroque pattern也被称为KáRMáN涡街。* * * *的vortices春面obstacle itself能力，为流体流动过去也dragged向内by friction和开始在itself掉头。涡的街道是常见的在自然世界。他们可以看到在云formations级空气流过去的一些disrupting influence这样一个年代的地区的高压力。他们从春
“移动脚的水strider propped起来by surface tension在池塘的表面，和他们的棚是由flapping翅膀的insects，这cleverly maneuver的翅膀，所以航班到收获的小推从eddies给他们额外的电梯。

The growth of wavy patterns in smooth laminar flow is said to be a kind of flow instability:
it signals the onset of the less regular and more turbulent motion that will appear at still greater flow speeds. Something similar can be found when two layers of fluid move past each other in opposite directions, or more generally,when they move at different speeds, so that one drags against the other. This situation is called a shear flow, and again it is ubiquitous
in nature, especially in the atmospheric flows of our planet and others, such as the swirling gaseous atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. The wavy disturbance is self-amplifying: as soon as it appears, it has a tendency to grow, the waves deepening and sharpening. This self-amplification is a common condition of pattern formation.
在平稳的层流波浪模式的生长被认为是一种流动的不稳定性：
它的信号的不规则运动，会出现更大的流动速度和湍流的发生。类似的事情时可以发现两层流体移动过去彼此相反的方向，或更一般地，当他们移动的速度不同，所以，一个将对其他。这种情况被称为剪切流动，这又是普遍存在的
在自然界中，尤其是在我们的星球和其他大气流动，如旋转的气体Jupiter和萨图恩。波状扰动是自我放大：当它出现时，它有增长的趋势，波浪的深化和锐化。这是一个自我放大模式形成的一般条件。

Finding order in chaos
Jupiter’s atmosphere is turbulent. Aside from the parallel bands called zonal jets, the flows are fast enough to wash away any truly regular pattern, and the shapes and forms of the vortices are constantly changing and shifting. Yet the flow doesn’t look simply random: there is a kind of elegant beauty to it, punctuated as it is with pockets of organized motion. The famous Great
Red Spot is the most prominent: an enormous storm with winds of up to 350 miles an hour, which has been raging for at least two centuries, possibly several more. Smaller vortices come and go, some lasting decades before they are dissipated or swallowed.
That’s just how it is with turbulence: it might not have a pattern in the usual sense but, like the branches of a tree or the ever-diminishing echoes of a fractal, it seems to hint at some deep structure beyond bewildering chaos. Can we make this impression more precise? Can we describe the shapes of turbulence?
混沌中的秩序
木星的大气是湍流的。除了平行带称为纬向射流外，水流足够快，可以冲走任何规则的模式，旋涡的形状和形式也在不断变化和变化。然而，这种流动并不是简单随意的：它有一种优雅的美，有点像有组织的运动口袋。著名的大人物
红斑是最突出的：一场风速达350英里每小时的巨大风暴，已经持续了至少两个世纪，可能还有几次。更小的旋涡来来去去，有的持续几十年才被消耗或吞噬。
这只是它是如何与动荡：它可能没有通常意义上的模式，但是，像一棵树或不断减少的分形与分支，它似乎暗示了一些深层结构超越困惑的混乱。我们能让这个印象更精确吗？我们可以描述湍流的形状？

Scientists have studied turbulent flow for hundreds of years, and yet still they cannot claim to fully understand it. It’s one thing to have the right equations that describe the motion, but quite another to solve them. The basic challenge of fluid flow, especially with turbulence, is that everything seems to affect everything else. This acute sensitivity of the flow to every tiny nuance makes the situation chaotic: it becomes impossible to predict, by looking at the flow pattern at one point in time, how it will look at a later stage.
Given this unpredictability, can we hope to say anything at all about the “shape of turbulence”?
Yes, we can. Even if we can’t predict exactly what a particular flow will look like, we might say something about its average properties.
科学家们已经研究了几百年的湍流，但他们仍然不能声称完全理解它。用正确的方程描述运动是一回事，但解决它们又是另一回事。流体流动的基本挑战，特别是湍流，是一切似乎都会影响其他一切。这种流动对每一个细微细微差别的敏锐敏感性使情况变得混乱：通过观察一个时间点的流动模式，它无法预测未来阶段的情况。
鉴于这种不可预测性，我们是否希望对“湍流的形状”有任何发言权？
是的，我们可以。即使我们不能准确地预测一个特定的流将是什么样子，我们可以说一些关于它的平均性质。

One of the first people to make headway with this question was Lewis Fry Richardson, the mathematician who first discerned the general concept of what we now call fractal structure.
Richardson was interested in turbulent flow partly because he was working on weather prediction,and he suggested that it might be imagined as a “cascade” in which the energy of the moving fluid is passed down from large eddies to ever smaller ones, until finally it gets dissipated as heat in the random motions of the fluid molecules. It was later shown that this energy cascade obeys a mathematical law in which the amount of energy bound up in eddies of a particular size is related to that size via a rather simple equation.
在这个问题上取得进展的第一人是Lewis Fry Richardson，数学家谁首先发现了我们现在所称的分形结构的一般概念。
理查德森是在湍流中感兴趣的部分原因是因为他工作上的天气预报，他建议，可以想象为“级联”的运动流体的能量通过从大涡越来越小的，直到最后它得到热在消散E液体分子的随机运动。后来证明，这个能量级串服从一个数学定律，能量束缚在一个特定大小的涡量大小有关，通过一个相当简单的方程。

As with fractals themselves, this mathematical law encodes a kind of “hidden regularity” among the apparent disorder—a cryptic pattern, if you like.
The basic idea seems sound, although there are still debates about, for example, how quickly (if at all) a turbulent flow can be restored to a more orderly state, or whether there is more than one type of turbulence.
随着分形本身，这个数学规律编码一种“潜规律”的明显障碍神秘的模式中，如果你喜欢。
基本的想法似乎是合理的，尽管仍有争论，例如，如何快速（如果有的话）湍流可以恢复到一个更为有序的状态，或者是否有一种以上的湍流。

Turning over
The Earth’s atmosphere is never still. Air is always on the move somewhere as winds bear it from regions of high to low pressure. But the cause of this flow is, at root, not so much variations in pressure as in temperature. Close to the surface,heat radiating from the land or sea warms the air, and as it heats up it expands and becomes less dense. This gives it buoyancy, and it rises.
Higher in the atmosphere it cools again, becomes more dense, and sinks. This rising of warm, less dense air and sinking of cool, denser air is called convection. It doesn’t happen at random, but is organized into three vast conveyors in each hemisphere—belts parallel to the equator in which air rises along one edge and sinks along the other. They carry heat and moisture with them,governing the climate regimes of the planet.
翻车
地球的大气层永远不会静止。空气总是在移动，风住了从高到低压力区。但这个流程的原因，根本没有那么多的压力变化和温度。接近地表，从陆地或海洋温暖的空气散热，当它升温膨胀，密度变小。这使它浮力上升。
高等大气中冷却了，变得更致密，汇。这种上升的温暖，密度较小的空气下沉的凉爽，稠密的空气称为对流。这并不偶然，而是分为三个巨大的传送带在每个半球带平行，空气上升沿一个边汇沿其他赤道。它们携带热量和水分，统治地球的气候制度。

Convective flow often adopts states of patterned self-organization. Imagine a shallow layer of water heated in a pan. The warm liquid on the bottom is buoyant and “wants” to rise—but how is it to get past the denser liquid above? The answer is that there is spontaneous symmetrybreaking: the uniform layers of liquid break up into circulating cells of more or less regular shapes,with the warm liquid rising in some parts and cooler liquid sinking in others. Some of these patterns can become astonishingly well ordered. In the atmosphere, their shapes can impose order on the clouds, creating the parallel stripes of “cloud streets,” sometimes called a mackerel sky because of its resemblance to the striped markings of those fish. Even the ferocious convection on the Sun doesn’t just result in disarray. The Sun’s surface is covered with so-called “solar-granules,“ patches that are darker at the edges than in the middle, and which change and shift every few minutes.
对流常采用图案化自组织状态。想象一个浅层的水在锅里加热。底部的温热液体是浮力的，“想要”上升，但是它是如何通过上面的稠密液体的呢？答案是，有自发的对称破缺：均匀的液体层分裂成循环形状的或多或少的规则形状的细胞，暖液体在某些部位上升，冷却器液体在其他部分下沉。这些模式中的一些可以变得令人惊讶地井井有条。在大气中，它们的形状可以在云层上施加秩序，产生平行的“云街”条纹，有时被称为鲭鱼天空，因为它与条纹条纹的鱼相似。即使是在太阳上的猛烈对流也不只是导致混乱。太阳表面覆盖着所谓的“太阳颗粒”，在边缘比中间更暗，每隔几分钟变化一次。


3 SUNSPOT
Even the seething surface of the Sun is patterned.Convection in the hot plasma creates this “granulated” structure of bright spots in a web of slightly dimmer (cooler) regions. The black structure in the center is a sunspot, which is even cooler still.
3太阳黑子
即使是炽热的太阳表面也被图案化。热等离子体中的对流在轻微变暗（凉爽）区域的网状物中产生这种“粒状”结构。中心的黑色结构是太阳黑子，甚至更冷。

Flocking and swarming
As dusk dims the fall sky, starlings gather and flock in search of a place to roost. They are looking for woodlands, buildings, piers, and reed beds where they can find shelter from harsh weather and predators. The flock might swell to many thousands—even hundreds of thousands—of birds, and as it grows it displays one of the most astonishing sights in nature. Twisting and turning, shifting from near transparent to opaque as the angles of the birds’ bodies change in our line of sight, the flock becomes a so-called “murmuration” in which these creatures seem to have acquired a group mind as they maneuver in unison.
群集蜂群
黄昏时分，黄昏时分，椋鸟聚集在一起寻找栖息之地。他们正在寻找林地、建筑物、码头和芦苇床，在那里可以找到严酷的天气和掠食者的避难所。成群的鸟可能会成千上千只甚至成百上千只鸟，随着它的生长，它展现出自然界中最令人惊叹的景象之一。随着鸟类身体的角度在我们的视线中变化，扭转和转动，从接近透明变为不透明，羊群变成所谓的“喃喃”，这些生物在它们一致行动的时候，似乎已经获得了群体思维。


How do they do it? All it takes is for each bird to observe some rather simple rules of motion. They avoid crashing into each other or getting too close. They try to match their direction of movement to the average direction of their neighbors. And they try not to drift too far apart. A bird in one part of the flock has not the slightest idea of what others far away are doing; it is merely attentive to those close by.
The same sort of behavior can be seen in schooling fish and swarming locusts or bats. The coherent movements are very effective
at communicating information fast: waves can ripple quickly through the crowd, so that the alarm signs of an approaching predator are rapidly sent to fish far from the danger spot.
他们是怎么做到的？每一只鸟都需要观察一些简单的运动规律。他们避免撞到对方或太接近。他们试图将他们的移动方向与邻居的平均方向相匹配。他们尽量不分开太远。一只鸟在羊群的一部分，丝毫不知道远处的其他人在做什么，它只关心身边的人。
同样的行为可以在学校的鱼和蜂拥的蝗虫或蝙蝠身上看到。连贯的动作非常有效。
在快速传播信息的过程中，海浪可以很快地在人群中传播，从而使接近捕食者的警报信号迅速地被送到远离危险点的鱼身上。

PATTERNS IN NATURE
Convection can create order in frigid conditions, too. In the remote frozen wastes of Alaska and Scandinavia, you might come across
stones seemingly arranged into patterns on the tundra by frost giants—ring-shaped mounds as tall as a person is high, or great pebbles disported in rows and stripe formations as though shepherded by a massive rake. Needless to say, no intelligent beings have carried out such a pointless feat of landscaping. The stones have been heaved into place by convection currents in water that freezes and thaws cyclically just beneath the ground surface.
自然界的模式
对流可以在寒冷条件下创造秩序，太。在遥远的阿拉斯加和斯堪的纳维亚的荒芜，你可能会遇到的
看似排列成图案的霜巨人的苔原石环形土墩作为一个人高高，或大鹅卵石嬉戏行和条纹形成仿佛带由一个巨大的耙。不用说，没有智能生物都进行这种毫无意义的壮举的美化。石头被扔进的地方在水的对流冻结和融化的循环就在地面上。

River’s edge
Fluid flow can become not just a patterned phenomenon but a patterning agent itself: the shapes and forms of the water leave permanent traces. Streams, rivers, and oceans pick up sand, silt, and stones and shift them in the current, and the resulting processes of erosion and deposition rearrange the landscape into patterns that are as pleasing as they are surprising. The meanders of a river are one of the best-known examples of how feedback processes create order and structure.
河边
流体流动不仅可以是图案化现象，也可以是图案化剂本身：水的形状和形式留下永久痕迹。河流、河流和海洋吸收沙子、淤泥和石头，并将它们转移到水流中，由此产生的侵蚀和沉积过程将景观重新排列成令人惊讶的令人愉悦的模式。河流的蜿蜒曲折是反馈过程如何创造秩序和结构的最著名的例子之一。

Because the water flows faster on the outside edge of a meander, and slower on the inside, the river bank becomes more eroded on the outer bend while silt gets deposited on the inside. This means that bends, once they appear, bulge ever outward as though a bubble is being blown in the river’s course. Eventually the two sides of the loop meet and coalesce, and the bulge is pinched off into an ox-bow lake.
因为水流动速度对弯曲的外边缘，慢在里面，河岸变得更加侵蚀在外弯而淤泥沉积在里面。这意味着，一旦出现弯曲，向外凸出，就像一个泡沫是吹在河道。最终双方的环满足和融合，和凸起的夹断进入牛轭湖。

If sediment erosion and deposition are particularly strong, this restructuring creates a much more complex river form than a lone, meandering thread. Channels branch off, intersect, and reconnect, and the water’s course becomes a delicate, many-stranded braid in which there is a constant dialog between flow and stasis, between water and earth. We can see these patterns in the tapestry of shallow water running across the sand into the sea. The slightest impediment of pebble or shell sets up chevronlike shapes that overlap and interfere. One way or another, the river reaches the sea, flowing to the pattern of its own inexorable and beautiful logic.
如果泥沙冲淤都特别强，这一重组创造了一种比孤独更复杂的河流形态，蜿蜒的螺纹渠道分流，相交，并重新连接，和水的过程变得微妙，许多搁浅的辫子这是流动和停滞之间的不断对话，水和地球之间。我们可以看到这些图案的挂毯浅水跑过沙滩大海。卵石或外壳设置chevronlike形状重叠和干扰丝毫阻碍。一种或另一种方式，河水流入大海，流入自己的必然和美丽的逻辑模式。

These organized vortices form in the air above the ocean (as traced by clouds) when winds are disturbed by obstacles such as islands protruding from the water’s surface.
Here, the flow patterns include mushroom-shaped “dipole” vortices and a tight succession of vortices alternating in direction, called a Kármán vortex street. Note that these flow structures can also form without the clouds, but they will not then be visible.

BENDING LAWS
There’s a subtle logic to the forms of river meanders, which dictates that as the river channel gets narrower, the bends get tighter and their “wavelength” decreases. In other words, the ratio of river width to meander wavelength stays more or less the same.

RIPPLES AT THE BORDER
When one stream of a fluid—air or water, say—passes past another at a different speed, the interface between the two can develop a wavy shape. The different flow speeds create a difference in pressure across the boundary, which can amplify any random ripple into a more pronounced wave. Eventually this wave can peak, crest,and break into a series of curlicue vortices, as seen here traced out by clouds in the atmosphere (1 and 2) and in computer simulations of flow (3and 4). The emergence of these wavy patterns is called a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, after the two scientists who explained it.
边境的涟漪
当流体或水的一个流，例如以不同的速度通过另一个流时，两者之间的界面可以发展成波浪形。不同的流动速度在边界上产生压力差，可以将任何随机波纹放大为更明显的波。最终，该波可以达到峰值、波峰，并形成一系列曲线状涡旋，如图所示，由大气中的云（1和2）和流的计算机模拟（3和4）跟踪。在解释这两个科学家之后，这些波浪型的出现被称为Kelvin Helmholtz不稳定性。





THE POWER OF WAVES
High-speed photographs of breaking waves capture the extraordinary elegance and coherence of the flow—a degree of organization normally all but invisible to the naked eye, but the kind of “deep order” that Leonardo da Vinci sought to intuit and illustrate.

SAND PATTERNS
The range of patterns that can stem from sand grains being eroded,carried, and rearranged by flowing water is immense. Some are braided, some branched or ridged, or shaped like fanning chevrons.
They depend on many factors—the speed and depth of the flow, say,or the cohesion of the sand grains, or how readily the slopes tumble in little avalanches.
砂纹
由沙粒侵蚀、携带和重新排列的水流所形成的图案范围是巨大的。有的是辫状的，有的是分枝的，有的是脊状的，有的形状像扇形的雪佛龙。
它们取决于许多因素，比如水流的速度和深度，或者沙粒的内聚力，或者斜坡在小雪崩中的倾斜程度。




STONE CIRCLES
So-called “patterned ground,” like the rings of stones seen here in the Norwegian tundra, is created by convection currents in the water that freezes and thaws underground over the seasonal cycle. Because water has the peculiar property of being denser a few degrees above freezing point than just before it freezes, water that thaws and warms close to the surface becomes denser than the almost-frozen water below, and it sinks. This produces convective circulation, which becomes organized into more or less regular “cells.” Stones in the ground are corralled by the circulation into subsurface clusters such as clumps or rings, which may then be brought to the surface by the well-known process of “frost heaving,” familiar to farmers (since it scatters their fields with stones), when the ground freezes. Sometimes the convection patterns produce stripes of stones rather than these rings.
石圈
所谓“图案的地面，“就像在这里看到挪威苔原石环，是由水冻结和融化地下的季节循环对流产生的。因为水具有高几度冰点以上只是冻结之前的特有性质，水融化和温暖接近表面变得致密比几乎结冰的水下，它下沉。这就产生了对流循环，从而变得更多或更少的正常细胞”。“在地面上的石头被从循环到地下的集群如团块或环，然后可能引起“冻胀知名过程表面，“秘境懂得农民（因为它将自己的田地的石头），当地面结冰。有时对流模式产生条纹的石头，而不是这些环。

How to make a chemical clock

如何制作化学钟


In a real sense, all of nature is waves. Light and sound are undulations, the oceans and the atmosphere support oscillations, and pulses of activity quicken the heart and the brain. Quantum physics tells us that the smallest particles of matter may act like waves in the right circumstances. The wave is a pattern in time as well as space: it is a constant pulse, a periodic coming and going.
When one wave meets another, their interference can create spectacular new patterns. But perhaps most astonishing of all are waves that organize themselves from sheer disorder or from seemingly inexorable, one-way processes: from the chemical reactions between molecules moving at random,say, or the collisions of wind-blown sand. In such cases, waves can imprint themselves on matter with a flamboyant ebullience.
从本质上说，自然界的一切都是波浪。光和声音是波动的，海洋和大气支持振荡，活动的脉冲加速心脏和大脑。量子物理学告诉我们，在适当的情况下，最小的物质粒子可能像波一样作用。波是时间和空间的模式：它是一个恒定的脉冲，一个周期性的来来往往。
当一个波与另一个波相遇时，它们的干涉可以创造出壮观的新模式。但也许最令人吃惊的是，这些波是从纯粹无序或看似不可阻挡的单向过程中组织出来的：来自随机移动的分子之间的化学反应，或者说是风沙的碰撞。在这种情况下，波浪可以以华丽的沸腾方式在物质上留下印迹。



1 CELLULAR SCROLLS
The soil-dwelling slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum will, when stressed by lack of water or nutrients, aggregate into clumps of cells.
This occurs as the cells emit regular pulses of a chemical attractant, which makes the colony organize itself into concentric and spiral wave forms like these.

2 and 3 CHLADNI FIGURES
Waves are at the root of the patterns called Chladni figures, made by vibrating a flat plate onto which fine grains are scattered—for example, using sound waves.
2和3克拉德尼图形
波是被称为ChrdNi图形的根部，通过振动一个平板，用声波散射细颗粒。

The slime mold leads an undistinguished life. It lives in soil and rotting leaves, where it feeds on Dictyostelium discoideum bacteria. It exists as single-celled organisms visible only under a microscope: fifty of them head to toe would stretch for just a millimeter. But if these primitive cells find themselves short of nutrients,heat, or moisture, they do a remarkable thing.
They become artists.
That’s a bit of a fanciful way to put it, perhaps—but there’s no denying that the patterns formed by Dictyostelium cells under stress are beautiful. The colony organizes itself into ranks:
lines of cells densely clustered, separated by more sparsely populated gaps. These ranks aren’t straight, but are curved into delicate spiral forms.
As the cells march forth in regular array, the spirals spread outward like rippling waves, turning as they do so. Where two spiral waves meet, they destroy one another. The result is mesmerizing.
黏菌导致一种与众不同的生活。它生活在土壤和腐烂的叶子上，它在盘基网柄菌上觅食。它存在于单细胞有机体中，只有在显微镜下才能看到：它们的头到趾的五十只会延伸一毫米。但是，如果这些原始细胞缺乏营养、热量或水分，它们就做了一件了不起的事情。
他们成为艺术家。
这是一种奇怪的说法，但不可否认，网盘菌细胞在压力下形成的图案是美丽的。殖民地把自己组织成等级：
细胞密集丛生，由较稀疏的间隙分隔。这些等级不是直的，而是弯曲成精致的螺旋形。
当细胞以规则排列的方式前进时，螺旋状物向外传播，就像波纹波一样。在两个螺旋波相遇的地方，它们互相破坏。结果令人着迷。

This behavior can be regarded as the cells’ attempt to dance their way out of danger. The wave patterns are just the first stage in a process
in which cells gradually crawl toward one another and clump together in a mound resembling a tiny slug. This mass of perhaps a hundred thousand cells starts to act like a single organism, wriggling its slimy way in search of water or warmth. Once it finds a better environment, it forms into a finger that stands upright, at the tip of which a bulbous, fruitlike shape balloons out that contains hardy spores in suspended animation, ready to germinate into new cells.
As survival mechanisms go, it’s impressive and inventive. But how do the cells manage such a collaborative feat? They do it by communicating chemically. Under stress, they start to emit a chemical compound that attracts other cells nearby, much as some animals emit pheromones to attract mates. But crucially, this chemical attractant is released in regular pulses, and it’s this rhythmic emission that creates the waves among the slime-mold population.
这种行为可以被视为细胞试图摆脱危险的尝试。波型只是一个过程中的第一个阶段，在这个过程中，细胞逐渐向另一个方向爬行，并聚集在一个类似小蛞蝓的土丘中。大概有十万个细胞的细胞开始像一个生物体一样，蠕动着它那黏糊糊的方式寻找水或温暖。一旦它找到了一个更好的环境，它就形成一个直立的手指，在它的顶端有一个球状的、果子状的球状气球，在悬挂的动画中含有顽强的孢子，准备发芽成新的细胞。
随着生存机制的发展，它是令人印象深刻和创造性的。但是细胞如何管理这样的合作壮举呢？他们通过化学交流来做到这一点。在压力下，它们开始发射一种化合物，吸引附近的其他细胞，就像一些动物发出信息素来吸引配偶一样。但关键的是，这种化学引诱剂以规则的脉冲释放出来，正是这种有节奏的发射在黏菌种群中产生了波。

If that steady pulse reminds you of a heartbeat, so it should. With its coordinated waves of activity, the Dictyostelium colony is behaving like the cardiac cells of the heart, which generate regular pulses of electrical activity that enable the muscles to contract with a steady beat,pumping blood. The comparison is deeper than you might imagine, for the electrical waves of the heart can also take on a spiral formation. If they do, however, it’s bad news: this particular pattern of “heart-wave” activity signals the onset of rapid pulses, faster than the normal heartbeat, that may then break down into quite random, shallow muscular spasms, producing the life-threatening condition called atrial fibrillation. Spiral waves in Dictyostelium are a survival stategy; in the heart they can be fatal.
Waves permeate all of nature—quite literally.
如果那个稳定的脉搏提醒你心跳，那么它应该是。盘基网柄菌群具有协调的活动波，其行为类似于心脏的心脏细胞，它产生规则的电活动脉冲，使肌肉与稳定的搏动收缩，抽血。这个比喻比你想象的要深刻，因为心脏的电波也可以螺旋形地形成。然而，如果他们这样做的话，这是个坏消息：这种“心波”活动的特定模式预示着快速脉搏的发作，比正常心跳快，然后可能分解成相当随机、浅层的肌肉痉挛，从而产生危及生命的状态，叫做心房颤动。盘基网柄菌中的螺旋波是一种生存策略；在心脏中，它们可能是致命的。
波很自然地渗透到自然界的各个角落。

Sound waves are vibrations of the air, while light is a wave of oscillating electrical and magnetic fields, supporting one another as they advance through space faster than anything else.
When they encounter one another, waves may “interfere.” Depending on whether they are in or out of step, their peaks and troughs might reinforce one another or cancel out, and the resulting interference patterns can be beautiful, as when water waves bounce off the edges of walls, bathtubs, and river banks. Interference of light waves gives rise to spectacular colors, like those of soap films or oil films on the surface of a wet road. When waves are confined within a fixed space, like sound waves in an organ pipe, certain frequencies and patterns may be picked out in the phenomenon of resonance. The eighteenthcentury scientist and musician Ernst Chladni discovered that resonances in a metal plate, when it is vibrated by drawing a violin bow across one edge, can usher fine grains scattered on the surface into ornate patterns that follow the nodes,where there is no up and down vibration.
声波是空气的振动，而光是一个振荡的电场和磁场的波，相互支持，因为它们比其他东西更快地推进空间。
当它们相遇时，波浪可能会“干扰”，这取决于它们是否在台阶中，它们的波峰和波谷可能相互加强或抵消，由此产生的干涉图案可以是美丽的，就像水波从墙壁、浴缸的边缘反弹出来一样。河岸。光波的干涉会产生壮观的色彩，比如湿路面上的肥皂膜或油膜。当波被限制在一个固定的空间内，如器官管中的声波时，在共振现象中可以挑选出特定的频率和模式。18世纪的科学家和音乐家Ernst Chladni发现，金属板中的共振，当它通过拉一个小提琴弓在一个边缘上振动时，可以将细小的颗粒分散在表面上，形成一个遵循节点的华丽图案，在那里没有上下振动。


Chemical clocks
But the waves of Dictyostelium and the heart are different from these. They are not vibrations in any real sense: nothing is “shaking” the slime mold or the heart tissue. The waves are self-organized: they spring right out of the medium that carries them.
It’s as if a cup of coffee suddenly separated out into rotating spirals of cream in the dark liquid.
If it seems unlikely to you that such things could happen, your intuition would be justified—but wrong. That’s exactly how chemists felt when,in the 1950s, spontaneous wave formation was discovered by a Soviet chemist in a mixture of apparently innocuous ingredients. Their discoverer,Boris Belousov, was accused of incompetence,because what he had found didn’t seem possible:
化学钟
但盘基网柄菌和心脏的波动与这些不同。它们不是真正意义上的振动：没有任何东西在“振动”粘液或心脏组织。波浪是自组织的：它们从携带它们的介质中弹出。
就像一杯咖啡突然在黑暗的液体中分离出来，变成螺旋状的奶油。
如果你觉得这样的事情不可能发生，你的直觉是合理的，但却是错误的。在20世纪50年代，苏联化学家在一种看似无害的成分的混合物中发现了自发波的形成，这正是化学家们所感受到的。他们的发现者Boris Belousov被指控无能，因为他所发现的似乎不可能：

a chemical reaction that seemed to proceed spontaneously first in one direction, then in the opposite direction. In other words, it oscillated,as if time were swinging back and forth. In the 1960s a young Russian biochemist named Anatoly Zhabotinsky made some changes to Belousov’s recipe that switched the mixture, more strikingly,between red and blue. There was no denying it now: the reaction really did oscillate back and forth. This mixture has become known as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction.
The oscillations don’t last forever. Left in a beaker, the reaction will, after a long time, eventually settle down into a single state and stay there. But you can keep the color changes going indefinitely if you keep feeding the mixture with fresh ingredients and flushing away the ones that have reacted—in other words, if you keep up an input of matter and energy, which can stop the reaction from reaching its final or “equilibrium” state. The oscillations are a non-equilibrium phenomenon. This is a common feature of many of the pattern-forming processes in nature: they are far from their equilibrium state, kept there by a constant influx of energy. The perpetual repetitive circulating motions of the oceans, for example, are driven by the heat of the sun.
一种化学反应，似乎首先自发地在一个方向上进行，然后在相反的方向上进行。换句话说，它摆动着，好像时间在来回摆动。20世纪60年代，一位名叫Anatoly Zhabotinsky的年轻俄罗斯生物化学家对Belousov的配方做了一些改变，使混合物更加醒目地在红和蓝之间转换。现在不可否认：反应确实来回振荡。这种混合物已被称为Belousov Zhabotinsky（BZ）反应。
振荡不会永远持续下去。留在烧杯里，反应很长一段时间后，最终会落入一个单一的状态，留在那里。但是，如果你继续用新鲜的原料喂养混合物，并把那些已经反应的物质冲走，换句话说，如果你保持物质和能量的输入，这可以阻止反应达到最终或“平衡”状态，你可以保持颜色变化无限期地进行下去。振荡是一种非平衡现象。这是自然界许多模式形成过程的共同特征：它们远离它们的平衡状态，通过能量的不断涌入保持在那里。例如，海洋的永久重复循环运动是由太阳的热量驱动的。

In 1910, an Austrian-American ecologist named Alfred Lotka described a theory of oscillating chemical reactions in which he showed that a combination of particular reactions between the different ingredients can lead to a seesawing alternation between different states.
In one state one ingredient is present at a high concentration, so the mixture might be one color; in the other state a different reagent might
dominate, producing a different color.
Lotka wasn’t, in fact, particularly interested in chemistry. As an ecologist he was trying to understand animal populations—he was just using chemical reactions as an analogy. Imagine a population of rabbits preyed on by a population of foxes. Rabbits are noted for their ability to replicate, and the more of them there are, the more they breed. This can lead to a population explosion. If rabbits were molecules, they would be called auto-catalysts. A catalyst is a molecule that speeds up the rate at which a reaction happens: an auto-catalyst is one that speeds up the rate of its own production. Auto-catalysis is a positive feedback process: it can produce a runaway effect, blowing up out of control.
1910，一位名叫Alfred Lotka的奥地利裔生态学家描述了一种振荡化学反应的理论，在这一理论中，他显示了不同成分之间的特定反应的组合可以导致不同状态之间的跷跷板交替。
在一种状态下，一种成分以高浓度存在，因此混合物可能是一种颜色；在另一种状态下，不同的试剂可能是一种颜色。
主宰，产生不同的颜色。
事实上，洛特卡对化学特别感兴趣。作为生态学家，他试图了解动物种群，他只是用化学反应作为类比。想象一下一群狐狸捕食的兔子。兔子以其复制能力而著称，它们的数量越多，繁殖就越多。这可能导致人口爆炸。如果兔子是分子，它们将被称为自动催化剂。催化剂是一种加速反应速率的分子：自动催化剂是加速自身生产速率的催化剂。自动催化是一个正反馈过程：它可以产生失控的效应，失控。

Unchecked, the rabbit population will grow until it has consumed all the food (grass), and then it crashes to extinction.
But the foxes keep this runaway process in check. The more rabbits there are, the more the foxes thrive by eating them. It’s a delicate balance.
If the foxes are too ravenous, they will eat all the rabbits; then they will starve.
Alternatively, the ecosystem might develop an oscillating state. The foxes eat so many rabbits that there’s little prey left, and the fox population declines. This gives some respite to the remaining rabbits, and their population grows. That creates an abundance of prey for the surviving foxes, and their numbers grow until they have overwhelmed the rabbits and they go into decline again through lack of food… and so on. At one point in the cycle, there are plenty of rabbits but few foxes; at another point, the reverse is true.
未经检查，兔子的数量将增长，直到它消耗了所有的食物（草），然后它崩溃到灭绝。
但狐狸保持这种失控的过程检查。兔子越多，狐狸吃的越多。这是一种微妙的平衡。
如果狐狸太贪婪，他们会吃掉所有的兔子，然后它们就会饿死。
或者，生态系统可能发展为振荡状态。狐狸吃了这么多兔子，剩下的猎物很少，狐狸数量减少了。这给剩下的兔子一些喘息的机会，它们的种群也在增长。这就为幸存的狐狸创造了大量的猎物，它们的数量不断增长，直到它们战胜了兔子，它们由于缺乏食物而再次衰败……等等。在周期的某一点，有很多兔子，但狐狸很少；另一方面，反过来是正确的。

This was basically the scheme devised by Lotka, although he expressed it in terms of chemicals that are auto-catalytic or react with and “consume” other chemicals. Several decades later it was pointed out that in a chemical mixture in which the ingredients aren’t perfectly mixed so that their concentration is the same everywhere,the oscillations depend on two things: how fast the molecules react (which consumes them) and how fast they move by random diffusion from place to place (which replenishes the ingredients).
Because of the two competing processes, these are called reaction-diffusion systems.
这基本上是由Lotka发明的方案，尽管他用化学催化的方式来表达，这些化学物质是自动催化或与其他化学物质“消耗”。几十年后，人们指出，在一种化学混合物中，成分不完全混合，以致它们的浓度在每一个地方都是相同的，振荡取决于两个因素：分子的反应速度（消耗它们）和它们通过随机扩散运动的速度。从一个地方到另一个地方（补充成分）。
由于这两个相互竞争的过程，这些被称为反应扩散系统。


1 BRANCHING OUT
The cells of slime molds often gather together into a mass called a plasmodium, which can take on complex shapes because of the chemical signals that the cells exchange. This is a plasmodium of the mold Fuligo septica, sometimes called scrambled egg slime.
1分支
粘液细胞通常聚集在一起，称为疟原虫，由于细胞交换的化学信号，它可以形成复杂的形状。这是败酱草霉菌的疟原虫，有时称为炒鸡蛋泥。


2 LIESEGANG ROCKS
These patterns are not lichen growing on the rocks, but are part of the rock itself.
They are created by a wavelike crystallization process when the rock is formed—notice how the wave fronts annihilate one another when they intersect. These structures are called Liesegang rings, after the German scientist who first identified the pulsating precipitation phenomenon.
2列塞岗岩体
这些图案不是在岩石上生长的地衣，而是岩石本身的一部分。
当岩石形成时，它们是由波浪状的结晶过程创造的，注意波阵面在相交时如何相互湮灭。这些结构被称为列涩刚环，在德国科学家首次发现脉动降水现象之后。



CORRUGATED DESERTS
Wind arranges sand grains into regular structures such as these parallel ripples.
They are self-organized patterns arising from the amplification of small random bumps —a process that can only proceed when one bump is a certain minimum distance from the preceding one. As a result, the ripples have a preferred wavelength, picked out by the particulars of the wind speed and the average grain size.

“Waves permeate all of nature—quite literally.”
波纹荒漠
风将沙粒排列成规则结构，如这些平行波纹。
它们是由小随机凸点的放大所产生的自组织模式，该过程只能在一个凸起与先前的一个凸起之间存在一定的最小距离时才进行。因此，纹波有一个优选的波长，由风速的细节和平均晶粒尺寸挑选出来。
“波很自然地渗透到自然界。”


Ripples in nature
The clock like switching between a red-filled and blue-filled flask is pretty to behold, but the process is capable of more than this. If you mix the components of the BZ reaction, pour them into a flat dish, and leave them to do their thing,you see something considerably more spectacular than a uniform color change. Instead, the switch to a new color starts at a few specific spots in the liquid and spreads out from there, producing circular patches. In the wake of this spreading wave, the mixture starts to revert to the other color. But then a new wave springs from the same spot in the next cycle of the oscillation. The process repeats again and again with a regular pulse, producing concentric circular waves of color that grow like ripples on a pond where a stone has fallen in. These are chemical waves, driven by the competition of reaction and diffusion.
Patterns produced by chemical waves are seen in a wide range of different chemical systems. They are formed on the surfaces of metals that catalyze the reactions between gas molecules sticking to the metal; here the patterns are generally microscopically small. And if the concentric bands remind you of the patterns found in minerals such as onyx and agate, that seems to be no coincidence. These bands are formed by the crystallization of different mineral types when the stones grow from warm, saltladen fluids in the Earth’s crust as the fluids cool.
自然界的涟漪
时钟在红色填充和蓝色填充烧瓶之间切换是很明显的，但是这个过程的能力远远不止于此。如果你把BZ反应的成分混合在一起，把它们倒进一个扁平的盘子里，让它们做它们的事情，你会看到比均匀的颜色变化更引人注目的东西。相反，切换到一个新的颜色开始在液体中的几个特定点，并从那里展开，产生圆形补丁。在这种扩展波之后，混合物开始回复到另一种颜色。但是，在下一个振荡周期中，一个新的波从同一个点弹出。这个过程一次又一次的重复着一个规则的脉冲，产生一个同心的圆形波，就像一个石头落在池塘里的涟漪。这些是化学波，由反应和扩散的竞争驱动。
化学波产生的模式见于各种不同的化学体系中。它们形成在金属表面上，催化气体分子粘附在金属上的反应；这里的图案通常是微观上小的。如果同心带提醒你在矿物中发现的图案，如玛瑙和玛瑙，那似乎不是巧合。这些带是由不同矿物类型的结晶形成的，当石头在地球地壳中从温暖、含盐流体中生长时，流体冷却。

It seems that this crystallization process happens in waves that are much like the chemical waves of the BZ reaction, only in this case frozen in place for millennia.
The target and spiral patterns of the BZ reaction look just like those made by Dictyostelium discoideum as the slime-mold cells search each other out to form their life-preserving “mushroom.” Both are chemical reactions of a kind, but very different: in one case there’s just a soup of simple ingredients, in the other there are swimming cells that are emitting pulses of chemical attractant. And as we saw earlier, the surges in these systems also look like the waves of electrical activity that pass through heart muscle to trigger the rhythmic contractions of the heartbeat. How come the patterns are so similar in such diverse systems?
That’s because in all cases the basics are the same, irrespective of the details. The whole “fabric” of these systems—the solution of chemicals, the colony of cells, the heart tissue—is capable of switching between two different states, and that switching involves feedback processes and auto-catalysis. It’s even the same for the foxes and rabbits: if, say, the initial rabbit population varies slightly in number from one place to another in the landscape, at random, then patches where the population is denser might become the source of waves of population growth that radiate outward—followed close after by waves of glutted foxes.
似乎这种结晶过程发生在波，很像BZ反应的化学波，只有在这种情况下，在几千年内冻结。
BZ反应的靶标和螺旋状与盘基网柄菌所形成的黏黏细胞一样，互相寻找，以形成其保存生命的“蘑菇”。两者都是一种化学反应，但非常不同：在一种情况下，只有一种简单的汤。成分，另一种是有化学吸引物脉冲的游泳池。正如我们之前看到的，这些系统中的浪涌也像是通过心脏肌肉的电活动波，触发心跳的节律收缩。为什么在这样多样的系统中模式是如此相似？
这是因为在所有情况下，基本细节都是一样的，不管细节如何。这些系统的整个“织物”——化学物质的解决方案，细胞的集合，心脏组织能够在两种不同的状态之间切换，并且切换涉及反馈过程和自动催化。狐狸和兔子也是一样的：如果说，最初的兔子数量在数量上从一个地方到另一个地方在数量上是随机变化的，那么人口密集的斑块可能会成为人口增长的来源，辐射波随C向外辐射。被贪食的狐狸迷住了。

Reaction-diffusion processes can explain the wavy pigment patterns formed on the shells of mollusks such as shellfish and snails (invisibly small spirals may also appear among the microsopic terraces of the shell mineral itself). The positive feedback that produces such pattern features also seems to be at work in the formation of dunes and ripples in wind-blown desert sand. Dunes can take on many forms: the parallel ranks of longitudinal dunes; seif dunes that undulate like snakes; isolated crescent-shaped mounds called barchan dunes; and star dunes, with several arms radiating from a central peak rather like a starfish. Dunes have been seen on Mars, which also has vast sandy deserts stirred by winds—but the different planetary conditions may produce patterns found nowhere on Earth. There are even dunes on Saturn’s moon Titan, with grains made not of sand but of frozen hydrocarbon compounds, a bit like wax, perhaps coated with ice. They are a striking reminder that self-organized pattern formation is a feature of the cosmos: the details may change but the basic processes stay the same. It’s for this reason that no world is likely to be tot ally alien to us.
反应扩散过程可以解释贝类和蜗牛等软体动物贝壳上形成的波浪状色素（在壳矿物本身的微斜面上也可能出现不可见的小螺旋）。产生这种模式特征的正反馈也似乎在风沙沙漠中沙丘和波纹的形成中起作用。沙丘可以有多种形式：平行沙丘的纵向沙丘；起伏的沙丘，波浪状的蛇；孤立的新月形土丘，称为新月形沙丘；以及星状沙丘，有几个臂从中央峰辐射，相当于海星。沙丘已经在Mars上看到了，这里也有巨大的沙尘被风搅动，但是不同的行星条件可能会产生地球上没有发现的模式。土星的卫星泰坦上甚至有沙丘，沙粒不是沙子，而是冰冻的碳氢化合物，有点像蜡，也许涂上了冰。它们是一个惊人的提醒，自组织模式的形成是宇宙的一个特征：细节可能改变，但基本过程保持不变。正因为这个原因，没有一个世界可能与我们完全陌生。


1 CHEMICAL WAVES
A mixture of chemical ingredients called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction undergoes oscillations, first producing products of one color (red) and then another (blue) as time ticks by (see above). If the reaction is left to proceed in an unstirred, flat dish, the oscillations create waves that emanate from some central point,making these concentric target and spiral patterns. The wave fronts annihilate each other when they touch.
1化学波
被称为Belousov Zhabotinsky反应的化学成分的混合物经历振荡，首先产生一种颜色（红色），然后产生另一种（蓝色），随着时间的推移（见上文）。如果反应在未搅拌的平盘中继续进行，则振荡产生从一些中心点发出的波，使这些同心目标和螺旋模式。波阵面在它们接触时相互湮灭。




2 SHELL PATTERNS
The shells of some bivalves may develop microscopic spiral and target patterns engraved on the growing biomineral surface, which look very similar to those produced by chemical waves in the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction.
2壳模式
一些双壳类的壳可以在生长的生物矿物表面上雕刻出微小的螺旋状和靶状图案，看起来与BelousovZhabotinsky反应中化学波产生的相似。




RIPPLING PATTERNS
Ridges in wind-blown sand and pigmentation patterns on mollusk shells are both a kind of frozen wave. The sand ripples are in fact still slowly changing, as fresh sand is deposited by the wind. The regular spacing is dictated by interactions between each ripple. The shell patterns are produced by waves of pigmentation moving along the rim of the shell as it is formed, in a process thought to bear some similarities to the way chemical waves arise in the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction.
纹波图案
风沙脊和软体动物壳上的色素沉着模式都是一种冻结波。事实上，沙尘暴是缓慢变化的，因为新鲜沙子是被风沉积的。规则间隔由每个纹波之间的相互作用决定。壳层图案是由形成在其周围的壳边缘的色素波产生的，这一过程被认为与BelousovZhabotinsky反应中化学波产生的方式有一些相似之处。




WAVES OF PIGMENTATION
As mollusk shells grow, pigmented material is sometimes laid down along the rim. If there are periodic bursts of pigmented and unpigmented growth, the result is banding perpendicular to the axis of the conical shell. If pigmentation happens at fixed spots around the rim, the result is stripes parallel to this axis. And if the pigmentation occurs as waves that progress steadily around the rim, it produces slanting stripes. All of these are akin to the way chemical-wave patterns form.
色素沉着波
随着软体动物壳的生长，色素物质有时沿着边缘沉积下来。如果有周期性爆发的着色和未着色的增长，结果是绑扎垂直于圆锥壳的轴线。如果色素沉着发生在边缘周围的固定点，结果是平行于该轴的条纹。如果色素沉着像波浪一样稳定地围绕着轮辋，就会产生倾斜的条纹。所有这些都类似于化学波模式的形成方式。




ROCK PATTERNS
In some minerals, such as the agates shown here, waves of crystallization as the mineral is formed produce a frozen record of the so-called “reaction-diffusion” process underlying it.
岩石模式
在一些矿物中，如这里所示的玛瑙，形成矿物的结晶波产生了所谓的“反应-扩散”过程的冻结记录。



DESERT’S TEETH
These irregular, wavy dunes in the Namib desert of Namibia are among the highest in the world, reaching up to 984 feet (300 meters). The bluish region is a dried-up river bed, with white encrustations of salt. A road is just about visible as a narrow lightblue line running through its center.
沙漠牙齿
纳米比亚纳米比亚沙漠中这些不规则起伏的沙丘是世界上最高的，达984英尺（300米）。蓝色的区域是干涸的河床，有白色的盐覆盖层。一条道路几乎可以看得见，就像一条狭窄的淡蓝色线穿过它的中心。






BACTERIAL ART
Chemical communication between bacterial cells can make the colony grow into complex shapes, such as these intricately branched structures. Occasionally a random genetic mutation in the colony might convey an advantage that suddenly switches the shape of growth, as the mutant proliferates faster than the others.
细菌艺术
细菌细胞之间的化学通讯可以使菌落生长成复杂的形状，如这些错综复杂的分支结构。偶尔，在殖民地的随机基因突变可能传达的优势，突然切换生长的形状，因为突变体增殖比其他人更快。






DUNES ON MARS
Winds blow across the sandy deserts of Mars, and form dunes and other patterns just as they do on Earth. Some of these echo the dune shapes seen on Earth, such as the crescent-shaped barchan dunes (1), but others have shapes not found on our planet. That’s because there are different conditions on Mars that affect the way grains are transported and how they bounce: the gravity is weaker, the atmosphere is thinner, and the winds can be much faster
火星上的沙丘
风吹过Mars的沙漠，形成沙丘和其他图案，就像在地球上一样。其中一些与地球上出现的沙丘形状相呼应，例如新月形新月形沙丘（1），但其他的形状在我们的星球上却没有。这是因为Mars上有不同的条件影响谷物运输的方式以及它们如何反弹：重力较弱，大气更薄，风也快得多。





6 BUBBLES & FOAM
Why bees know best and why froth inspires architects
气泡与泡沫
蜜蜂为什么最了解为什么泡沫激发建筑师



HEXAGONAL NEST CELLS
A wasp (Vespula vulgaris) working on its nest. Why and how does it make the cells hexagonal?
六角巢细胞
在巢穴里工作的黄蜂（Vespula vulgaris）。为什么和怎样使细胞变成六角形？

“To the natural philosopher there is no natural object unimportant or trifling,” wrote the English scientist John Herschel in 1830. “A soap bubble…an apple…a pebble. He walks in the midst of wonders.” Soap bubbles might indeed seem like trifling child’s play, but some of the finest minds in science have been captured by their charm and beauty, as well as perplexed by their shapes. Soap films and foams observe a particular economy, a precise balance of shaping agencies that stretches and pushes them into graceful curves and frameworks. Nature sometimes makes ingenious use of these patterns to build architectures that are both useful and extravagant.
1830岁的英国科学家约翰·弗里德里希·威廉写道：“对自然哲学家来说，没有自然物体是不重要的，也不是微不足道的。”一个肥皂泡…一个苹果…一块鹅卵石。他走在一片奇观之中，“肥皂泡似乎真的像儿戏，但科学上最优秀的一些人却被他们的魅力和美貌所迷惑，也被他们的形状所迷惑。肥皂膜和泡沫观察到特定的经济，精确的平衡机构，伸展和推动他们进入优美的曲线和框架。自然有时会巧妙地利用这些模式来建造既有用又奢侈的建筑。

How do bees do it? The honeycombs in which they store their amber nectar and nurture their larvae are marvels of precision engineering, an array of prism-shaped cells with a perfectly hexagonal cross-section. The wax walls are made with a very precise thickness, the cells are gently tilted from the horizontal to prevent the viscous honey from running out, and the entire comb is aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field.

Yet this structure is made without any blueprint or foresight, by many bees working simultaneously and somehow coordinating their efforts to avoid mismatched cells.
蜜蜂是怎么做到的？它们储存琥珀花蜜和培育幼虫的蜂窝是精密工程的奇迹，一组棱柱形的细胞具有完美的六边形横截面。蜡壁用非常精确的厚度制成，细胞从水平方向轻轻倾斜以防止粘稠的蜂蜜流出，整个梳子与地球磁场对齐。
然而，这种结构是没有任何蓝图或远见，许多蜜蜂同时工作，不知何故协调他们的努力，以避免不匹配的细胞。

The ancient Greek philosopher Pappus of Alexandria thought that the bees must be endowed with “a certain geometrical forethought.” And who could have given them this wisdom, but God? According to William Kirby in 1852, bees are “Heaven-instructed mathematicians.” Charles Darwin wasn’t so sure, and he conducted experiments to establish whether bees are able to build perfect honeycombs using nothing but evolved and inherited instincts, as his theory of evolution would imply.
Why hexagons, though? It’s a simple matter of geometry. If you want to pack together cells that are identical in shape and size so that they fill all of a flat plane, only three regular shapes (with all sides and angles identical) will work:
equilateral triangles, squares, and hexagons. Of these, hexagonal cells require the least total length of wall, compared with triangles or squares of the same area. So it makes sense that bees would choose hexagons, since making wax costs them energy, and they will want to use up as little as possible—just as builders might want to save on the cost of bricks. This was understood in the eighteenth century, and Darwin declared that the hexagonal honeycomb is “absolutely perfect in economizing labor and wax.”
Darwin thought that natural selection had endowed bees with instincts for making these wax chambers, which had the advantage of requiring less energy and time than those with other shapes. But even though bees do seem to possess specialized abilities to measure angles and wall thickness, not everyone agrees about how much they have to rely on them. That’s because making hexagonal arrays of cells is something that nature does anyway.
亚历山大市古希腊哲学家帕帕斯认为蜜蜂必须被赋予“某种几何学的先见之明”，谁能给他们这种智慧，但上帝呢？根据William Kirby在1852，蜜蜂是“天堂指示数学家。”Charles Darwin不太确定，他做了实验，以确定蜜蜂是否能够用进化和遗传的本能来构建完美的蜂巢，正如他的进化论所暗示的那样。
为什么六边形呢？这是一个简单的几何问题。如果你想把形状和大小相同的细胞包在一起，使它们填充一个平面，那么只有三个规则的形状（所有边和角度相同）将起作用：
等边三角形、正方形和六边形。其中，六角形单元与相同区域的三角形或正方形相比，需要最少的总壁长。因此，蜜蜂选择六边形是有道理的，因为制作蜡会使它们消耗能量，而且他们会想尽可能少地使用，就像建筑商可能想节省砖块的成本一样。这在十八世纪被理解，达尔文宣称六角蜂窝是“完全节省劳动和蜡的完美”。
达尔文认为自然选择赋予蜜蜂制造这些蜡室的本能，它比其他形状的人需要更少的能量和时间。但是，尽管蜜蜂确实具有专门测量角度和壁厚的能力，但并不是每个人都同意它们必须依靠它们。这是因为制造六边形排列的细胞是自然界所做的事情。

Releasing the tension
If you blow a layer of bubbles on the surface of water—a so-called “bubble raft”—the bubbles become hexagonal, or almost so. You’ll never find a raft of square bubbles: if four bubble walls come together, they instantly rearrange into three-wall junctions with more or less equal angles of 120˚ between them, like the center of the MercedesBenz symbol.
Evidently there are no agents shaping these rafts as bees do with their combs. All that’s guiding the pattern are the laws of physics. Those laws evidently have definite preferences, such as the bias toward three-way junctions of bubble walls. The same is true of more complicated foams. If you pile up bubbles in three dimensions by blowing through a straw into a bowl of soapy water you’ll see that when bubble walls meet at a vertex, it’s always a four-way union with angles between the intersecting films roughly equal to about 109˚—an angle related to the four-faceted geometric tetrahedron.
What determines these rules of soap-film junctions and bubble shapes? Nature is even more concerned about economy than the bees are.
释放张力
如果你在水面上吹一层气泡，所谓的“泡泡筏”——气泡变成六边形，或者几乎是这样。你永远找不到一排方形的泡泡：如果四个气泡墙聚集在一起，它们会立即重新排列成三个壁结，它们之间的角度大约为120°，就像梅塞德斯奔驰符号的中心一样。
显然，没有蜜蜂用它们的梳子来塑造这些筏子。指导这一模式的一切都是物理定律。这些定律显然有明确的偏好，例如对气泡壁的三向连接点的偏倚。对于更复杂的泡沫也是如此。如果你把一根稻草吹入一碗肥皂水中，在三个维度上堆积气泡，你会发现，当气泡壁在顶点处相遇时，它总是一个四通的结合，在相交的膜之间夹角大致等于约109°-与四面土工格栅有关的角度。四面体
是什么决定了肥皂膜结和气泡形状的规则？自然比蜜蜂更关心经济。

Bubbles and soap films are made of water (with a skin of soap molecules) and surface tension pulls at the liquid surface to give it as small an area as possible. That’s why raindrops are spherical (more or less) as they fall: a sphere has less surface area than any other shape with the same volume. On a waxy leaf, droplets of water retract into little beads for the same reason.
This surface tension explains the patterns of bubble rafts and foams. The foam will seek to find the structure that has the lowest total surface tension, which means the least area of soap-film wall. But the configuration of bubble walls also has to be mechanically stable: the tugs in different directions at a junction have to balance perfectly,just as the forces must be balanced in the walls of a cathedral if the building is going to stand up.
气泡和肥皂膜是由水（具有肥皂分子的皮肤）和表面张力拉到液体表面，使它尽可能小的面积。这就是雨滴落下时是球形（或多或少）的原因：一个球体的表面积比任何体积相同的形状都要小。在一片蜡质的叶子上，由于同样的原因，水滴收缩成小珠。
这种表面张力解释了气泡筏和泡沫的模式。泡沫将寻求找到具有最低总表面张力的结构，这意味着肥皂膜壁的最小面积。但是，泡墙的结构也必须是机械稳定的：在一个结处的不同方向上的拖曳物必须完美地平衡，就像在建筑物的壁上必须平衡的力量一样。

The three-way junction in a bubble raft, and the four-way junctions in foam, are the configurations that achieve this balance.
But those who think (as some do) that the honeycomb is just a solidified bubble raft of soft wax might have trouble explaining how the same hexagonal array of cells is found in the nests of paper wasps, who build not with wax but with chewed-up wads of fibrous wood and plant stem,from which they make a kind of paper. Not only can surface tension have little effect here, but it also seems clear that different types of wasp have different inherited instincts for their architectural designs, which can vary significantly from one species to another.
Although the geometry of soap-film junctions is dictated by this interplay of mechanical forces, it doesn’t tell us what the shape of the foam will be.
泡沫筏中的三通结和泡沫中的四通结是实现这种平衡的结构。
但是那些认为（蜂巢）只是一个固化的软蜡泡泡筏的人可能无法解释如何在纸黄蜂巢中发现同样的六角形排列的细胞，它们不是用蜡而是用咀嚼的纤维木和植物茎来制造的。克是一种纸。不仅表面张力在这里几乎没有影响，而且似乎也很清楚，不同类型的黄蜂对它们的建筑设计有不同的遗传本能，这可以从一个物种到另一个物种显著地变化。
虽然肥皂膜结的几何形状是由机械力的相互作用决定的，但它并不能告诉我们泡沫的形状。

A typical foam contains polyhedral cells of many different shapes and sizes. Look closely and you’ll see that their edges are rarely perfectly straight;they’re a little curved. That’s because the pressure of the gas inside a cell or bubble gets bigger as the bubble gets smaller, so the wall of a small bubble next to a larger one will bulge outward slightly. What’s more, some facets have five sides,some six, and some just four or even three. With a little bending of the walls, all of these shapes can acquire four-way junctions close to the “tetrahedral” arrangement needed for mechanical stability. So there’s a fair bit of flexibility (literally) in the shapes of the cells. Foams, while subject to geometrical rules, are rather disorderly.
Suppose that you could make a “perfect” foam in which all the bubbles are the same size.
一个典型的泡沫包含许多不同形状和大小的多面体细胞。仔细观察，你会发现它们的边缘很少是完全直的，它们有点弯曲。这是因为当气泡变小时，细胞内或气泡内的气体压力越大，气泡越靠近大气泡的壁就会向外轻微膨胀。更重要的是，一些方面有五个方面，大约六个，一些只是四个甚至三个。由于墙壁有点弯曲，所有这些形状都能获得接近机械稳定性所需的“四面体”排列的四通结。所以在细胞的形状上有相当的灵活性（字面意思）。泡沫虽然受到几何规律的影响，却相当无序。
假设你可以做一个“完美”的泡沫，其中所有的气泡都是相同的大小。

What then is the ideal cell shape that makes the total bubble wall area as small as possible while satisfying the demands for the angles at the junctions? That has been debated for many years, and for a long time it was thought that the ideal cell shape was a 14-sided polyhedron with square and hexagonal faces. But in 1993 a slightly more economical—although less orderly—structure was discovered, consisting of a repeating group of eight different cell shapes. This more complex pattern was used as the inspiration for the foamlike design of the swimming stadium of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
The rules of cell shape in foams also control some of the patterns seen in living cells. Not only does a fly’s compound eye show the same hexagonal packing of facets as a bubble raft, but the light-sensitive cells within each of the individual lenses are also clustered in groups of four that look just like soap bubbles. In mutant flies with more than four of these cells per cluster,the arrangements are also more or less identical to those that bubbles would adopt.
什么是理想的细胞形状，使总气泡壁面积尽可能小，同时满足在路口的角度的要求？这已经争论了多年，长期以来，人们认为理想的细胞形状是具有正方形和六边形的14面多面体。但是在1993，发现了一个稍微经济些的，虽然结构不太有序，由一组重复的八个不同的细胞形状组成。这种更复杂的模式被用作北京2008奥运会游泳馆泡沫设计的灵感。
泡沫中细胞形状的规则也控制了活细胞中的一些模式。苍蝇的复眼不仅表现出与气泡筏相同的六角形包装面，而且每一个单独透镜中的感光细胞也聚集成四组，看起来就像肥皂泡。在每个簇中有超过四的这些细胞的突变苍蝇，排列也或多或少与气泡所采用的相同。


REPEATED SHAPES
Soap foams are made up of polyhedral bubbles, with flat faces and more or less regular shapes.
Their geometry is determined by a small set of approximate rules.
重复形状
肥皂泡沫是由多面体气泡组成的，具有平坦的表面和规则的形状。
它们的几何结构由一组近似的规则决定。



The economics of surfaces
Because of surface tension, a soap film stretching across a loop of wire is pulled flat like the springy membrane of a trampoline. If the wire frame is bent, the film also bends with an elegant contour that automatically tells you the most economical way, in terms of material, to cover over the space enclosed by the frame. That can show an architect how to make a roof for a complicated structure using the least amount of material. However, it’s as much because of the beauty and elegance of these so-called “minimal surfaces” as because of their economy that architects such as Frei Otto have used them in their buildings.
表面经济学
由于表面张力，一根横跨电线圈的肥皂膜被拉平，就像蹦床的弹性膜一样。如果线框被弯曲，胶片也弯曲一个优雅的轮廓，它会自动告诉你最经济的方式，在材料方面，覆盖在框架所包围的空间。这可以告诉建筑师如何用最少的材料为复杂的结构建造屋顶。然而，同样因为这些所谓的“极小表面”的美丽和优雅，因为他们的经济，像弗雷·奥托这样的建筑师在他们的建筑中使用了它们。

These surfaces minimize not only their surface area, but also their total curvature. The tighter the bend, the greater the curvature. As we saw in Chapter 1, curvature can be positive (bulges) or negative (dips, depressions, and saddles). A curved surface can therefore have zero mean curvature so long as the positives and negatives cancel each other out.
So a sheet can be full of curvature and yet have very little or even no mean curvature. Such a minimally curved surface can divide up space into an orderly labyrinth of passageways and channels—a network. These are called periodic minimal surfaces. (Periodic just means a structure that repeats identically again and again, or in other words, a regular pattern.) When such patterns were discovered in the nineteenth century, they seemed to be just a mathematical curiosity. But now we know that nature makes use of them.
这些表面不仅减小了它们的表面积，而且减小了它们的总曲率。弯曲越紧，曲率越大。正如我们在第1章中看到的，曲率可以是正的（凸起）或者是负的（凹陷、凹陷和鞍）。因此，只要正和负相互抵消，曲面就可以具有零平均曲率。
因此，一张纸可以充满曲率，但几乎没有或甚至没有平均曲率。这种极小的曲面可以将空间分割成通道和通道的有序迷宫，这是一个网络。这些被称为周期极小曲面。（周期只是指一种重复和重复的结构，换句话说，是一种规则的模式）当这些模式在十九世纪被发现时，它们似乎只是一种数学上的好奇心。但现在我们知道大自然利用了它们。

The cells of many different types of organisms, from plants to lampreys to rats, contain membranes with microscopic structures like this.
No one knows what they are for, but they are so widespread that it’s fair to assume they have some sort of useful role. Perhaps they isolate one biochemical process from another, avoiding crosstalk and interference. Or maybe they are just an efficient way of creating lots of “work surface, ” since many biochemical processes take place at the surface of membranes, where enzymes and other active molecules may be embedded. Whatever its function, you don’t need complicated genetic instructions to create such a labyrinth: the laws of physics will do it for you.
许多不同种类的生物细胞，从植物到灯盏花到大鼠，都含有像这样的微观结构的膜。
没有人知道他们是干什么的，但是他们是如此广泛，所以很公平地假设他们有某种有用的作用。也许他们将一个生化过程与另一个生化过程隔离开来，避免串扰和干扰。或者，它们可能是创造大量“工作表面”的一种有效方式，因为许多生化过程发生在膜表面，其中酶和其他活性分子可以被嵌入。不管它的功能是什么，你不需要复杂的遗传指令来创造这样一个迷宫：物理定律会为你做到这一点。

Some butterflies, such as the European green hairstreak and the emerald patched cattleheart, have wing scales containing an orderly labyrinth of the tough material called chitin, shaped like a particular periodic minimal surface called the gyroid. Interference between light waves bouncing off this regular structure within the wing scale causes some wavelengths—that is, some colors— to disappear while others (in this case, green) reinforce each other. So here the patterns offer a means of producing animal color.
一些蝴蝶，如欧洲绿毛斑纹和翡翠补丁的卡特尔心脏，有翅鳞片，包含一种被称为甲壳状的特殊周期性极小表面，称为甲壳质的硬性物质的有序迷宫。在翼鳞片内从这种规则结构中弹出的光波之间的干涉会引起一些波长，即某些颜色消失，而另一些波长（在这种情况下，绿色）相互加强。因此，这些图案提供了一种产生动物颜色的方法。


BUBBLE GEOMETRY
The junctions of soap films in the bubbles of a foam are generally fourfold, with the four edges pointing roughly to the corners of a tetrahedron.
Note that some bubble faces are curved rather than flat, because of the differences in gas pressure within the bubbles.
气泡几何结构
泡沫膜中肥皂膜的结通常是四倍的，四个边大致指向四面体的角。
注意，由于气泡内气体压力的差异，一些气泡表面是弯曲的而不是平坦的。


FOAM CRYSTALS
Diatoms, a kind of algae, are encased in a cage of hard, mineral silica called a frustule.
This is often intricately patterned with grooves, ridges, and holes, rather like a solidified foam. It’s thought that a foam made from soft bubblelike tissue acts as a mold during the growth of the frustule.
泡沫晶体
硅藻是一种海藻，被包裹在坚硬的矿物硅石笼中，称为截锥体。
这通常是复杂的图案，沟槽，脊和孔，而像凝固的泡沫。据认为，由软泡状组织制成的泡沫在截肢体的生长过程中起着霉菌的作用。


“Periodic minimal surfaces seemed to be just a mathematical curiosity. But now we know that nature makes use of them.”
“周期极小曲面似乎只是数学上的好奇心。但现在我们知道大自然利用了它们。”

Breaking the mold
The skeleton of the sea urchin Cidaris rugosa is a porous mesh with the shape of another kind of periodic minimal surface. It’s actually an exoskeleton, sitting outside the organism’s soft tissue, a protective shell that sprouts dangerous-looking spines made from the same mineral as chalk and marble. The open lattice structure means that the material is strong without being too heavy, rather like the metal foams used for building aircraft.
To create orderly networks from such hard, stiff mineral, these organisms apparently make a mold from soft, flexible membranes and then crystallize the hard material inside one of the interpenetrating networks. Other creatures may cast orderly mineral foams this way for more sophisticated purposes. Because of the way that light bounces off the elements of the patterned structure, such trellises can act rather like mirrors and conduits to confine and guide light. A honeycomb arrangement of hollow microscopic channels within the chitin spines of a peculiar marine worm known as the sea mouse turn these hairlike structures into natural optical fibers that can channel light, making the creature turn from red to bluish green depending on the direction of the illumination. This color change might serve to deter predators.
打破模具
海胆Cidaris rugosa的骨架是多孔网格，具有另一种周期极小表面的形状。它实际上是一个外骨骼，坐在生物体的软组织之外，是一种保护性外壳，它能发出与粉笔和大理石相同的矿物制成的危险外观的刺。开式格子结构意味着材料坚固而不太重，而类似于用于建造飞机的金属泡沫。
为了从这种坚硬、坚硬的矿物中形成有序的网络，这些生物显然是用柔软、柔软的膜制造出一个模子，然后结晶其中一个互穿网络中的硬材料。其他生物也可以按这种方式铸造有序的矿物泡沫，以达到更复杂的目的。由于光从图案化结构的元素中反弹，这种网格可以像镜子和管道一样限制和引导光。一种特殊的海洋蠕虫的甲壳质棘内的中空微通道的蜂窝排列，将这些毛发状的结构转变成天然的光纤，可以传导光，使生物根据疾病的方向由红色变成蓝绿色。赋值。这种颜色变化可能会阻止捕食者。

The principle of using soft tissues and membranes as molds for forming patterned mineral exoskeletons is widely used in the sea.
Some sponges have exoskeletons made of bars of mineral linked like climbing frames, which look remarkably similar to the patterns formed by the edges and junctions of soap films in foam —no coincidence, if surface tension dictates the architecture.
The formation of hard tissue, known as biomineralization, generates spectacular results in marine organisms called radiolarians and diatoms. Some of these have delicately patterned exoskeletons made from a mesh of mineral hexagons and pentagons: you might call them the honeycombs of the sea. When the German biologist (and talented artist) Ernst Haeckel first saw their shapes in a microscope in the late nineteenth century, he made them the star attraction of a portfolio of drawings called Art Forms in Nature, which were very influential among artists of the early twentieth century and still inspire admiration today. To Haeckel,they seemed to offer evidence of a fundamental creativity and artistry in the natural world—a preference for order and pattern built into the very laws of nature. Even if we don’t subscribe to that notion now, there’s something in Haeckel’s conviction that patterns are an irrepressible impulse of the natural world—one that we have every right to find beautiful.
用软组织和膜作为模板形成矿物外骨骼的原理在海洋中被广泛使用。
有些海绵的外骨骼由类似攀登框架的矿物棒制成，看起来与泡沫中肥皂膜的边缘和接合点形成的图案非常相似，如果表面张力决定了建筑结构，那就不是巧合。
硬组织的形成，被称为生物矿化，在被称为放射虫和硅藻的海洋生物中产生了惊人的结果。其中一些有精致的图案，由一个矿物六边形和五边形的网格构成：你可以称之为海洋的蜂窝。当德国生物学家（天才艺术家）艾伦斯特在十九世纪下旬在显微镜下第一次看到它们的形状时，他使它们成为自然界中艺术形式的组合的星体吸引物，这在二十世纪初和二十世纪的艺术家中是非常有影响的。直到今天才引起人们的钦佩。对海克尔来说，他们似乎提供了自然界中一种基本的创造性和艺术性的证据，偏爱于自然法则中的秩序和模式。即使我们现在不认同这一观点，海克尔坚信，模式是自然界的一种不可抑制的冲动，我们有权利去发现美丽。


FITTING IN
A single layer or “raft” of bubbles contains mostly hexagonal bubbles, albeit not all of them perfect hexagons. There are some “defects”—bubbles with perhaps five or seven sides. Nonetheless, all the junctions of bubble walls are threefold, intersecting at angles that are close to 120˚.
拟合
单层或“筏”的气泡主要包含六边形气泡，尽管并非全部都是完美六边形。有一些“缺陷”-气泡可能有五或七个方面。尽管如此，所有的气泡壁的交界处都是三倍的，在接近120°的角度相交。


FORCES AT WORK
Bees seem to have evolved capabilities for making perfectly hexagonal cells from the soft wax that they secrete. However, some researchers believe that surface tension in the soft wax might be sufficient to pull the cells into shape, in much the same way as it organizes bubbles in a bubble raft.
WORK部队
蜜蜂似乎已经进化出能够从它们分泌的软蜡中制造出完美的六角形细胞的能力。然而，一些研究人员认为，软蜡中的表面张力可能足以将细胞拉成形状，就像在气泡筏中组织气泡一样。





MICROSCOPIC HONEYCOMBS OF THE SEA
The complex, perforated exoskeletons of radiolarians are like “frozen foams”: they are made by the crystallization of a hard mineral at the junctions between bubblelike vesicles that are temporarily formed as the structure is deposited.
It’s no surprise, then, that they observe some of the “rules” of bubble layers, forming a roughly hexagonal arrangement in which the edges join in threes at approximately 120˚.
These basic principles are elaborated in many different ways in different species. Radiolarians like this are typically about 0.1–0.2 mm wide.
海洋微蜂窝
放射虫的复杂、穿孔的外骨骼就像“冻结的泡沫”：它们是在一个坚硬的矿物的结晶过程中形成的，在结构沉积时暂时形成的泡状囊泡之间的连接处。
这并不奇怪，他们观察到气泡层的一些“规则”，形成一个大致六边形的排列，其中边缘以120的距离连接在三个。
这些基本原理在不同物种中以许多不同的方式阐述。像这样的放射虫通常大约0.1到0.2毫米宽。


MAKING USE OF BUBBLES
Bubbles and foams are put to use in nature. Here the common purple snail (Janthina janthina) hangs onto the surface of the sea from a buoyant raft made of bubbles coated with mucus. This enables the snail to feed on small creatures that live at the water’s surface.
利用泡沫
气泡和泡沫在自然界中被使用。在这里，普通的紫色蜗牛（JANTYNA JANTINA）悬挂在海面上，由一个浮力筏制成，上面覆盖着粘液的气泡。这使得蜗牛可以吃生活在水面上的小生物。



STRUCTURAL COLOR
Tiny parallel ridges on the surfaces of the scales of butterfly wings cause interference in the reflected light that picks out certain colors—in
other words, some of these colors (particularly the iridescent blues and greens) are made not by light-absorbing pigments but by light-scattering structural patterns.
However, even closer inspection of the wing scales of some butterfly species shows a still finer and more intricate structure, as we will see
on the next page.
结构色彩
蝴蝶翅膀鳞片表面的微小平行脊会在反射光中干扰，从而吸收某些颜色。
换句话说，这些颜色中的一些（特别是虹彩蓝调和绿色）不是由光吸收颜料而是由光散射结构图案制成。
然而，对一些蝴蝶种类的翅膀鳞片的更仔细的检查显示出一个更精细和更复杂的结构，正如我们将在下一页看到的。


BUTTERFLY FOAM
These cross-sections of the wing scales of the green hairstreak butterfly (Callophrys rubi) show that the fabric, made from the glucose-based material chitin, is perforated with an ordered, threedimensional labyrinth of channels that has the same structure as a mathematical “periodic minimal surface” known as a gyroid. It is thought to be formed on a foamlike template made of soft membrane. The structure is strong and lightweight, but its key function is to cause interference of the reflected light rays so as to make the wing scales appear green.
蝶形泡沫
这些绿鳞蝶（Callophrys rubi）翅鳞片的横截面表明，由基于葡萄糖的材料甲壳素制成的织物被穿孔，其具有与数学“周期最小冲浪相同的结构”的有序的三维迷宫。“被称为陀螺状”。它被认为是在由软薄膜制成的泡沫状模板上形成的。结构坚固，重量轻，但其主要作用是引起反射光线的干涉，使机翼鳞片呈现绿色。




MINERAL MESH
The filigree porous skeletons of sponges, such as this Venus’s flower basket, are made from spines or “spicules” of glasslike material woven together.
矿物筛网
海绵的丝状多孔骨架，如维纳斯的花篮，是由棘状或类似于玻璃状物质的“针状物”编织而成的。



SEA SCULPTURES
Many marine organisms, including coccolithophores (1), diatoms (2 and 4), and dinoflagelletes (3), have hard exoskeleton shells that are delicately patterned, often with a porous, foamlike appearance. While it seems likely that they, too, are created by the deposition of a hard mineral on a template of soft organic material, the details of this process are in many cases not fully understood.
海雕
许多海洋生物，包括颗石藻（1）、硅藻（2和4）和甲藻（3），具有坚硬的外骨骼壳，它们被精细地图案化，通常具有多孔的、泡沫状的外观。虽然它们也可能是由硬矿物在软有机材料模板上沉积而形成的，但在许多情况下，这种过程的细节还没有完全理解。


KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
The sea urchin Cidaris rugosa defends itself with an armor cladding of spines, made from hard calcium carbonate patterned with intricate textures. This patterning continues down to the microscopic scale,where the mineral turns out to have the ordered, porous structure shown below.
保持距离
海胆Cidaris rugosa用盔甲包裹自己，由坚硬的碳酸钙制成，纹理复杂。这种图样继续向下延伸到微观尺度，其中矿物呈现出有序的多孔结构，如下所示。




BUBBLE VISION
The compound eyes of insects are packed hexagonally, just like the bubbles of a bubble raft—although, in fact, each facet is a lens connected to a long, thin, retinal cell beneath. The structures that are formed by clusters of biological cells often have forms governed by much the same rules as foams and bubble rafts—for example, just three cell walls meet at any vertex. The microscopic structure of the facets of a fly’s eye—beyond what is visible here—supplies one of the best examples. Each facet contains a cluster of four light-sensitive cells that have the same shape as a cluster of four ordinary bubbles.
气泡视觉
昆虫的复眼被包装成六角形，就像泡筏的气泡一样，事实上，每个小面都是一个透镜，连接在下面的一个又长又薄的视网膜细胞上。由生物细胞团形成的结构通常具有由与泡沫和气泡筏相同的规则所支配的形式，例如，只有三个细胞壁在任何顶点相遇。苍蝇眼的微观结构超出了这里所能看到的，这是最好的例子之一。每个小面都包含一组四个感光细胞，它们的形状与四个普通气泡的形状相同。





SHAPING A DROPLET
When water sits on a water-repellent surface, it may break up into droplets. The shapes of these drops are governed by surface tension, which pulls them into roughly spherical shapes, as well as by gravity (which will flatten a droplet on a horizontal surface) and the forces that act between the water and the underlying surface. If those latter forces are strong enough, the droplets are pulled into lens-shaped pancakes. And if the surface isn’t strongly water-repellent, the droplets may spread out into a flat, smooth film.
形成液滴
当水在防水表面上时，它可能分解成液滴。这些液滴的形状受表面张力的支配，表面张力将它们拉成大致球形的形状，以及重力（这将使水平表面上的液滴变平）和作用在水和下表面之间的力。如果后一种作用力足够强，液滴就会被拉成透镜状的煎饼。如果表面没有强烈的防水性，水滴可能会扩散到平坦光滑的薄膜中。




7 ARRAYS & TILINGS
Why crystals aren’t fve-sided—and how to make impossible ones that are
阵列与倾斜
为什么晶体不是边缘的，如何制造不可能的


Some early philosophers suspected that the world was, at root, geometric:
built by God according to simple mathematical rules. It was an understandable assumption if you think about crystals—the very stuff of the earth—with their orderly, faceted shapes. Miners and explorers of underground caverns could find themselves in a geometric universe, where all around nature was organized into glittering mathematical perfection. Wasn’t this evidence of nature’s fundamental order imprinting itself on matter?
一些早期哲学家怀疑这个世界是根深蒂固的几何：
由上帝根据简单的数学规则建造的。这是一个可以理解的假设，如果你认为水晶是地球上非常有序的、有刻面的形状的东西。地下洞窟的矿工和探险家们可以发现自己处于一个几何的宇宙中，周围的自然界被组织成闪闪发光的数学完美。这难道不是自然界的基本秩序在物质上烙印的证据吗？


CRYSTAL TAPESTRY
Crystals of magnesium chloride, seen under polarized light.
水晶挂毯
氯化镁晶体，偏振光下可见。

In the early seventeenth century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler wondered if there was a more tangible reason than God’s will for the shapes of crystals. In particular, he asked why snowflakes always have six points. He knew that if cannonballs are stacked compactly together, each ball is surrounded by six others at the corners of a hexagon. Might the sixfold symmetry of the icy snowflake come from the stacking of “globules” of frozen water?
十七世纪初，德国天文学家开普勒想知道是否有比水晶意志更真实的原因。特别是，他问雪花为什么总是有六点。他知道如果炮弹紧紧地堆积在一起，每个球在六边形的角上被六个球包围。冰雪的六重对称性是否来自冰冻水的“小球”堆积？

Kepler never got to the bottom of the snowflake problem—that took another four centuries. But his intuition about the cause of crystals’ regularity was right. The eighteenth century French priest and botanist René Just Haüy figured that crystal shapes are indeed dictated by the arrangements of their atoms. In his book on mineralogy in 1801—the founding text of the science of crystallography—Haüy showed how atom-stacking produces facets rather like the triangular faces of an ancient stepped pyramid.
Because of this atomic-scale structure, the shapes of crystals often echo those of the smallest repeating cluster of atoms in the crystal lattice. For ordinary rock salt (sodium chloride) this cluster is cube-shaped, and so are the crystals—as you can see by looking at table salt under a microscope.
开普勒从来没有到达雪花问题的底部，又花了四个世纪。但是他对晶体规律性原因的直觉是正确的。十八世纪的法国牧师和植物学家仁埃尔只是哈伊认为晶体的形状确实是由原子的排列决定的。在他的1801年的矿物学著作《晶体学》的创刊中，Huy展示了原子堆积是如何产生面的，就像古阶梯金字塔的三角面一样。
由于这种原子尺度结构，晶体的形状常常与晶格中最小的原子簇重复。对于普通岩盐（氯化钠），这个簇是立方体形状的，晶体也可以通过显微镜下观察食盐来观察。

Calcite, a mineral form of the compound calcium carbonate, has rhombus-shaped facets because that, too, is how the atomic building blocks
are arranged. These crystal shapes, or so-called “habits,” of minerals are diverse and beautiful, but all in some way bear the imprint, at scales we can see and touch, of the arrangements of the atoms that constitute them.
These crystal structures can be classified by their symmetry properties, just like the forms we looked at in Chapter 1—whether they can be rotated or reflected, say, to leave their appearance unchanged. There are only a fixed number of ways of arranging objects so that they will repeat again and again in perfect array. Each of these distinct repeating patterns is called a group, because it has an associated group of symmetry operations.
方解石是复合碳酸钙的一种矿物形式，具有菱形晶面，因为这也是原子块的排列方式。这些晶体的形状，或者所谓的“习惯”矿物是多样的和美丽的，但在某种程度上，它们承载着我们能看见和触摸的组成原子的排列的印记。
这些晶体结构可以根据它们的对称性质来分类，就像我们在第一章中看到的那样，它们是否可以被旋转或反射，比如说，使它们的外观不变。排列物体的方式只有固定的数量，所以它们会以完美的排列一次又一次地重复。这些不同的重复模式被称为一组，因为它有一组相关联的对称操作。

In two dimensions, for example, we can pack together squares, hexagons, and equilateral triangles this way into “tiling” patterns. If the tiles
are not regular polygons of this sort—if they are rectangles, say, like the arrangement of bricks in a wall—then there are other tiling groups, too.
There are precisely 17 of these two-dimensional “wallpaper” groups, many of which have been used in decorative schemes for walls and floors by various cultures since ancient times.
Crystals are made by stacking atoms in three dimensions. In this case, there are 230 symmetry groups (called space groups): 230 different ways of arranging objects into regular 3-D arrays. All crystals must belong to one of these groups—otherwise they couldn’t be true crystals, because they wouldn’t be made up of elements whose arrangement repeats again and again. (As we’ll see, though, this depends on how you want to define a crystal.)
例如，在两个维度中，我们可以将正方形、六边形和等边三角形以这种方式打包成“平铺”图案。如果砖块不是矩形的，如果它们是矩形，比如墙中砖的排列，那么也有其他瓷砖组。
有17个这样的二维“壁纸”群体，其中许多已经被用来装饰墙壁和地板的各种文化自古以来。
晶体是由原子在三个维度上堆积而成的。在这种情况下，有230个对称群（称为空间群）：将对象排列成规则的3-D阵列的230种不同方式。所有晶体都必须属于这些基团中的一个，否则它们不可能是真正的晶体，因为它们不会由排列重复的元素构成。（正如我们将看到的，这取决于你想要如何定义一个水晶。）

The simplest crystals, such as metals, are made of identical atoms. Since all the atoms are the same size, they can be efficiently packed together into hexagonal arrays, like the cannonball piles noted by Kepler. This is the densest possible way to stack spheres—a fact proved only in 1994—and it is called hexagonal close-packing. It has only about 25 percent empty space between the spheres. Some metals, such as iron, chromium, and tungsten, instead adopt a so-called “bodycentered cubic lattice”, in which the repeating unit consists of eight atoms at the corners of a cube and one in the middle. For cannonballlike spheres, this has 32 percent empty space. In diamonds,carbon atoms are packed into repeating patterns of eight atoms, again with a cubic shape, which for spheres leaves as much as 66 percent of the space empty. For crystals containing several or many different types of atoms, the atomic-scale structures can get pretty complicated, but the repeating patterns still have to correspond to one of the 230 space groups.
最简单的晶体，如金属，是由相同的原子构成的。因为所有的原子都是相同的大小，所以它们可以被有效地包装成六角形的阵列，就像开普勒所指出的炮弹堆一样。这是堆积球体的最密集的方法——事实证明只有在1994，它被称为六边形密堆积。球体之间只有约25%的空隙。一些金属，如铁、铬和钨，则采用所谓的“体心立方晶格”，其中重复单元由立方体的角上的八个原子和中间的一个组成。对于炮弹状的球体，它有32%个空的空间。在钻石中，碳原子被包装成八个原子的重复图案，再次呈立方形状，其中球体留下的空隙多达66%。对于含有多种或多种不同类型原子的晶体，原子尺度结构可能变得相当复杂，但重复的模式仍然必须对应于230个空间群中的一个。
The interference between X-rays bouncing off regular arrays of atoms and molecules produces a pattern of bright spots in the scattered beam from which the positions of the atoms can be deduced. This technique, called X-ray crystallography, was first used in the early twentieth century to deduce the crystal structures of simple minerals, but from the middle of the century it began to reveal the atomic structures of complex biological molecules such as proteins, enabling scientists to understand how life works at the molecular scale. In 1953 X-ray crystallography was used to study the crystals formed by DNA, and thereby to show that this vital biomolecule has its famous double-helix structure.
When a crystal melts to a liquid, it loses its atomic-scale order; there is no longer any regularly repeating array. However, some substances can melt in one direction while remaining ordered in others. In particular, some long, rod-shaped molecules may form liquids that flow, even though the molecules stay lined up roughly parallel to each other, a little like logs floating on a river. These are liquid crystals. In some liquid crystals the aligned molecules stack up in regularly spaced layers even though, within a given layer,the molecules move around and jostle like people in a crowd. The alignment of molecules in liquid crystals can make them scatter polarized light into spectacular patterns, from which it is possible to deduce something about the molecular order that the liquid crystal contains.
X射线在原子和分子的规则阵列上的碰撞产生散射光束中的亮点，由此可以推断出原子的位置。这种技术被称为X射线晶体学，最早在二十世纪初被用来推断简单矿物的晶体结构，但从本世纪中期开始，它揭示了诸如蛋白质等复杂生物分子的原子结构，从而使科学家们得以研究。坚持生命如何在分子尺度上运转。在1953，X射线晶体学被用来研究由DNA形成的晶体，从而表明这个重要的生物分子具有其著名的双螺旋结构。
当晶体熔化成液体时，它失去了原子级的顺序，不再有规则的重复排列。然而，一些物质可以在一个方向上熔化，而其余的则是有序的。特别是，一些长而杆状的分子可以形成流动的液体，即使分子大致平行地排列在一起，有点像漂浮在河上的原木。这些是液晶。在一些液晶中，排列的分子堆积在规则间隔的层中，即使在给定的层内，分子像一群人一样在周围移动和挤挤。液晶分子的排列可以使偏振光散射成壮观的图案，由此可以推断出液晶分子的分子有序性。


1 GROWING ICE
Ice crystals, like these on a window in winter, can grow into beautiful and complex branched shapes in a process called dendritic growth. The same process creates the shape of snowflakes.
1生长冰
冰晶，就像冬天窗户上的冰晶，在一种叫做树枝状生长的过程中，可以成长为美丽而复杂的分支形状。同样的过程会产生雪花的形状。

2 STAR QUALITY
Snowflakes display sixfold (hexagonal) symmetry.
This reflects the hexagonal arrangement of water molecules in the ice crystal, translated to a scale that can be seen (just) with the naked eye—but also elaborated into exotic patterns by the growth process of the flakes.
2星级质量
雪花显示六倍（六边形）对称性。
这反映了冰晶中的水分子的六边形排列，转化为一个可以用肉眼看到的尺度，但也通过薄片的生长过程阐述了奇异的模式。
矿物景观


MINERAL LANDSCAPES
Crystals may form complex structures and patterns over many different size scales, from the atomic level up, as seen in this sample of the mineral sphalerite (zinc sulfide).
晶体可以在许多不同的尺度上形成复杂的结构和图案，从原子水平上看，如矿物闪锌矿（硫化锌）的样品中所见。


The law of tiling, and how to break it The patterns of crystalline lattices are governed by strict geometrical rules that “forbid” certain types of symmetry. For the 17 two-dimensional tiling patterns, for example, the tiles can have the same symmetry as squares, rectangles, hexagons,rhombi, or triangles. You can rotate the pattern symmetrically by half a full revolution (for rhombic or rectangular tiles), or a quarter, a third, or a sixth—but not a fifth. There are no tile shapes that can be fitted together perfectly, with no gaps,to create a tiling lattice with fivefold symmetry:
瓷砖的规律，以及如何打破它的晶体晶格的模式是严格的几何规则，“禁止”某些类型的对称性。对于17个二维拼接图案，例如，瓦片可以具有与正方形、矩形、六边形、菱形或三角形相同的对称性。你可以通过半个完整的旋转（菱形或矩形瓦片），或四分之一，第三，第六，而不是第五的方式对称地旋转图案。没有瓷砖形状可以完美地配合在一起，没有缝隙，形成一个五重对称的瓷砖格子：

you can’t tile pentagons perfectly. The same is true for all tiles with more than sixfold symmetry (sevenfold, eightfold, and so on). This applies to 3-D space groups, too: you can’t make an orderly framework in three dimensions from units with fivefold symmetry. This might seem unfair on the pentagon, but it’s just a fact of basic geometry.
At least, so we thought until three decades ago, when a material that seemed to be crystalline was found to have one of these “forbidden” symmetries. In 1984, researchers working in the USA discovered an alloy of aluminum and the metal manganese that, according to X-ray crystallography, seemed to have tenfold crystal symmetry: X-rays bounced off this material to produce rings of ten equally spaced spots. That seemed to imply a crystal lattice with tenfold (or fivefold) symmetry, which was impossible according to the laws of geometry. What was going on?
你不能完美地瓦解五边形。对于具有六倍对称性的所有瓦片（七倍，八倍，等等）也是如此。这也适用于3-D空间组：你不能在三个维度上从五重对称的单元中形成有序的框架。这在五角大楼看来是不公平的，但这只是一个基本几何学的事实。
至少，我们认为，直到三年前，当一个似乎是晶体的材料被发现有一个“禁止”对称。1984，在美国工作的研究人员发现了一种铝和金属锰的合金，根据X射线晶体学，它们似乎具有十倍的晶体对称性：X射线从这一材料反弹出来，产生十个等间距的斑点。这似乎意味着一个具有十倍（或五倍）对称性的晶格，这是不可能的几何定律。发生了什么事？

This material was the first so-called “quasicrystal.” Over the following decade or so, scientists realized that it is possible to organize atoms into patterns with fivefold (and eightfold, tenfold, and twelvefold) symmetry that don’t quite repeat exactly, as crystals were known to do.
These patterns look at a casual glance as though they are pentagonlike lattices, but every so often the pattern slips, so that it is never possible to rotate or move it in a way that superimposes it exactly on itself. Despite this lack of perfect regularity and order, the pattern (when built from atoms) is orderly enough to produce bright spots in the reflected X-rays. The International Union of Crystallography has, in fact, now broadened the very definition of a crystal so that it can include quasicrystals.
这种材料是第一个所谓的“准晶”。在接下来的十年左右，科学家们认识到，有可能把原子组织成五倍（和八倍、十倍、十二倍）对称的图案，它们不象晶体一样被精确地重复。
这些模式看起来是偶然的一瞥，好像它们是五边形的格，但是图案经常滑动，所以它永远不可能旋转或移动它，使它完全叠加在自己身上。尽管缺乏完美的规律性和有序性，图案（当由原子构建时）是有序的，足以在反射的X射线中产生亮点。事实上，国际晶体学联合会扩大了对晶体的定义，使它可以包括准晶。

The easiest way to understand quasicrystal patterns is again to think of tilings in two dimensions, although the actual crystals are threedimensional. You can’t tile pentagons, but in the 1970s the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose discovered a set of two rhombus-shaped tiles that can be fitted together without gaps to create a lattice filled with fivefold symmetric shapes:
five-pointed stars and decagons, for example.
了解准晶体模式最简单的方法是重新考虑两个维度的倾斜，尽管实际晶体是三维的。你不能瓦解五边形，但在20世纪70年代，数学物理学家罗杰·彭罗斯发现了一组两个菱形瓦片，它们可以在没有间隙的情况下装配在一起，形成一个充满五重对称形状的格子：
例如，五尖星和十面格。

This tiling never quite repeats its pattern exactly, but if it is built up while applying a few simple rules about which tile can lie next to which, it can be extended forever. If you imagine putting an atom at the corner of each tile (or the equivalent rhomboids in three dimensions), you end up with an array that appears to be very much like the atomic lattice of a quasicrystal.
Such patterns, which seem to bend the rules of geometry, were already known to Islamic artists hundreds of years ago, who explored them in complex designs and mosaic tilings. Both because of religious restrictions on depictions of the natural world and because Islamic philosophers were deeply interested in mathematics, these tiling patterns were developed into a highly sophisticated art that can be found decorating shrines, mosques, and palaces throughout the Islamic world. One design on the Darb-i-Imam shrine in Isfahan, Iran, made in 1453, is almost identical to a Penrose tiling, with its mesmeric, never-quite-repeating pattern. The tiling patterns were constructed from conceptual building blocks called girih according to strict assembly rules similar (but not identical) to those used to make Penrose tilings.
这个瓷砖从来没有完全重复它的模式，但如果它是建立在应用几个简单的规则，哪些瓦可以躺在旁边，它可以永远延伸。如果你想象把原子放在每个瓦片的角上（或者在三个维度上等效的菱形），你就会得到一个看起来非常像准晶的原子晶格的数组。
这些图案，似乎弯曲几何规则，已经知道数百年前伊斯兰艺术家，谁探索他们在复杂的设计和马赛克倾斜。两者都是因为对自然世界的宗教限制，因为伊斯兰教哲学家对数学非常感兴趣，这些瓷砖图案被发展成一种高度复杂的艺术，可以在整个伊斯兰世界中装饰神龛、清真寺和宫殿。RLD。在伊朗伊斯法罕的DARB-IMAM神殿的一个设计，在1453，几乎是相同的彭罗斯瓷砖，其催眠，从来没有重复模式。根据GeIIH的概念构建块，根据严格的装配规则构造了拼接图案，这些规则与（Penrose tilings）的组装规则相似（但不完全相同）。


LIQUID CRYSTALS
These crystals have a liquidlike ordering of their molecules in one or two directions,while being disorderly and liquidlike in the others. The molecular arrangements can twist polarized light, resulting in these colorful textures when seen under a polarizedlight microscope.
液晶
这些晶体在一个或两个方向上具有液态的有序排列，而其它晶体则是无序的和液态的。分子排列可以扭转偏振光，在偏振光显微镜下看到这些彩色纹理。


Flowers of ice
Snowfl akes show the pattern-forming potential of crystals at its most exuberant. While Kepler guessed at the underlying reason for the geometric  regularity of crystals, in the snowfl ake this orderliness is taken to kaleidoscopic extremes,creating shapes in which the symmetry of the hexagon is embellished almost to an absurd degree. If the packing together of atoms and molecules generates blocky facets, why then do these ice crystals take on such delicate and ornate shapes?
Some snowfl akes are fancier than others. The spectacular frondlike fl akes commonly shown in snowfl ake pictures are usually cherry-picked from among less-perfectly symmetrical examples and, depending on the precise meteorological conditions (the air temperature and humidity), snow can also fall as simpler hexagonal plates or prisms. All the same, the variety and complexity of snowfl akes can be stunning, and it is a mystery even now why so often each arm mirrors the others down to the finest detail.
A typical snowfl ake arm is a needlelike ice crystal decorated by smaller needles that branch off at the “hexagonal angle” of 60˚. Why this branching? And why this hexagonality?
冰之花
雪崩显示出晶体形成潜力最大的模式。虽然开普勒猜测晶体的几何规律性的根本原因，但在雪崩中，这种有序性被视为万花筒极端，创造了六边形对称性几乎被装饰到荒谬程度的形状。如果原子和分子结合在一起会产生块状的小平面，那么为什么这些冰晶呈现出如此精致而华丽的形状呢？
有些雪花比其他的更好看。在雪佛兰AKE图片中通常显示出的壮观的正面FL通常是从不太完美的对称例子中挑选出来的，并且，根据精确的气象条件（空气温度和湿度），雪也可以像简单的六边形板或棱镜一样下降。尽管如此，雪花的多样性和复杂性也令人叹为观止，这是一个谜，即使是现在，为什么每一只手臂都会把其他人反射到最好的细节上。
一个典型的雪花臂是一种针状冰晶，由较小的针头装饰，以60度的“六边形角”分支。为什么分支？为什么这个六边形呢？

Although no other kind of crystal comes close to snowflakes for elaborate beauty, their pattern is not totally unique. When some molten metals solidify quickly, they too can sprout Christmastreelike arms. This phenomenon is called dendritic growth, after the Greek word for branch.
Dendritic growth is an example of a growth instability, which basically means that something gets blown up out of control as a shape or pattern grows. We saw in Chapter 2 how aggregation due to the sticking of randomly drifting particles produces the tenuous forms of fractals. Any bump that appears by chance on the surface of the cluster grows faster than the rest simply because it is more exposed. So randomness at the surface quickly gets amplified and the cluster sprawls into its monstrous, tendriled form.
虽然没有其他种类的水晶接近雪花，但它们的图案并不完全是独一无二的。当一些熔融金属快速凝固时，它们也能萌芽出类似于圣诞节的手臂。这种现象被称为树突生长，之后是希腊语分支。
枝晶生长是生长不稳定性的一个例子，这基本上意味着当形状或图案生长时，某些东西会失控。我们在第2章中看到了由于随机漂流颗粒的粘附而产生的聚集如何产生分形的脆弱形式。任何偶然出现在集群表面上的凸点都比其他区域增长得快，因为它暴露得更多。因此，表面上的随机性很快被放大，簇扩展成其庞大的、卷曲的形式。

Something similar happens in dendritic growth during freezing of a liquid: a random bump grows faster than the surface around it,this time because the bump is better at radiating away heat so that more crystal can grow there.
But this alone would make snowflakes ragged fractals. What about the hexagonal regularity?
This comes from the crystal structure of the ice itself, which contains water molecules linked into hexagonal rings. This structure means that the branching instability happens on a kind of microscopic hexagonal grid that sets up a bias for the directions in which the branches grow: they surge ahead faster at the hexagonal angles than at others. The combination of random branching and orderly underlying lattice creates the exquisite complexity of the snowflake, poised on the brink of chaos and minutely sensitive to tiny variations in the temperature and humidity of the air. This acute sensitivity ensures that no two snowflakes seem to be exactly alike: they are endless variations on a theme, as if trying to convince us of nature’s intrinsic creativity.
在液体冻结过程中树突的生长也会发生类似的变化：一个随机的凸起比它周围的表面生长得更快，这一次是因为凸起在散热方面更好，所以更多的晶体可以在那里生长。
但这只会让雪花碎裂。六边形规则是什么？
这来自于冰本身的晶体结构，它包含与六方环相连的水分子。这种结构意味着分支不稳定性发生在一种微观的六边形网格上，它为分支生长的方向设置偏置：它们在六边形角度比其他的更快地向前移动。随机分支和有序底层晶格的组合创造了雪花的精致复杂性，在混沌的边缘上，对空气温度和湿度的微小变化敏感。这种敏锐的敏感性确保了两个雪花看起来完全一样：它们是一个主题的无休止的变化，好像试图说服我们大自然的内在创造力。


Chemical gardens
Isaac Newton was convinced that metals and minerals possess what he called a “vegetative soul,” because of the way they could grow into structures that looked more like plants than crystals. Newton experimented with what are now often called chemical gardens—metal salts precipitated in a solution of what in Newton’s day was known as oil of sand,which is sodium or potassium silicate (water glass). The salts grow into weird tentacles and branching fronds, because the silicate forms a tough but flexible and water-permeable skin, through which the salt repeatedly bursts out upward.
化学花园
艾萨克·牛顿确信金属和矿物拥有他所谓的“营养灵魂”，因为它们可以生长成看起来更像植物而不是晶体的结构。牛顿实验了现在被称为“化学花园”的金属盐，在牛顿的日子里被称为“沙子油”，即钠或硅酸钾（水玻璃）。盐变成怪异的触须和分支的叶，因为硅酸盐形成坚硬但柔韧和透水的皮肤，盐通过它反复向上迸发。

The structures that result are peculiarly lifelike: they could be bizarre, bulbous root vegetables from an alien world. Some scientists speculate that complex mineral structures like this, wrapped in membranes, might have played a part in the origin of primitive life on Earth at deep-sea hydrothermal vents where warm mineralrich fluids spew out from the Earth’s crust.
A team of researchers at Harvard University has devised a particularly floral variant of the chemical garden process. They adjusted the acidity and concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide in the solution as crystals precipitated in water glass. This caused the tips of growing tendrils to blossom into curved and ruffled conelike shapes that, when examined under the microscope, look like flowers or corals—a chemical garden truly worthy of the name, and an indication that even crystals can escape from the chains of geometry to offer patterns of vivid,uninhibited artistry.
其结果是非常逼真的结构：它们可能是奇异的，来自异国世界的球根蔬菜。一些科学家推测，像这样包裹在膜中的复杂矿物结构，可能在深海热液喷口地球原始生命的起源中起了一定的作用，其中富含热的富含矿物质的流体从地球地壳喷出。
哈佛大学的一组研究人员设计出了一种特别的花卉化学变体。它们调节溶液中溶解的二氧化碳的酸度和浓度，作为沉淀在水玻璃中的结晶。这使得卷须的花瓣绽放成弯曲和皱褶的锥形形状，当在显微镜下观察时，它看起来像花朵或科拉尔——一个真正名副其实的化学园地，甚至表明晶体可以从几何链中逃逸出来。NS的生动，无拘束的艺术。

and, depending on the precise meteorological conditions (the air temperature and humidity), snow can also fall as simpler hexagonal plates or prisms.

CRYSTAL FLOWERS
Careful control of the growth conditions—temperature, acidity, and concentration of dissolved gas—gives rise to these ornate and diverse crystal shapes of barium carbonate and silica precipitated in a solution of metal salts. The basic forms are shaped like stems, vases, and corals; by switching the conditions during growth, the crystals can be guided into these and other flowerlike structures. The colors have been added to the image artificially to enhance the “botanical” appearance.
水晶花
仔细控制生长条件温度、酸度和溶解气体的浓度，会产生这些在金属盐溶液中沉淀的碳酸钡和二氧化硅的华丽和多样的晶体形状。基本形态如茎、花瓶和珊瑚；通过在生长过程中切换条件，晶体可以被引导进入这些和其他花状结构。颜色被人工添加到图像中以增强“植物学”的外观。


INTERFERENCE
The colors of this complex layered crystal in the shell of the New Zealand paua mollusk (1) and in the texture of this liquid crystal (2) are produced by interference effects in light. These may pick out the microscopic structures of the material. In the shell, we can see the terracelike layering of the hard mineral, organized by soft organic tissues during shell growth, while in the liquid crystal the microscopic structure comes from the shared orientation of rod-shaped molecules packed together.
干扰
在新西兰PaaA软体动物（1）的壳中和在该液晶（2）的织构中，这种复杂层状晶体的颜色是由光的干涉效应产生的。这些可以挑出材料的微观结构。在壳中，我们可以看到硬壳矿物的梯形层，在壳生长期间由软的有机组织组织，而在液晶中，微观结构来自棒状分子聚集在一起的共同取向。





CRYSTAL TREES
In the process known as dendritic growth, seen here in magnesium citrate (1) and ice (2), a growing crystal acquires a needlelike shape that is then decorated with side branches at successively finer scales. This process happens when tiny random bumps at the surface of the solidifying crystal get amplified and sharpened, because they are better at radiating the heat that needs to be shed for crystallization to occur. This, then, is another feedback process that generates pattern from randomness—in this case, given a degree of regularity by the order in the underlying atomic structure of the crystal.
水晶树
在被称为树枝状生长的过程中，如在柠檬酸镁（1）和冰（2）中看到的，生长的晶体获得针状形状，然后在连续精细的尺度上用侧枝装饰。这一过程发生在凝固晶体表面的微小随机凸点被放大和锐化时，因为它们更好地辐射了需要为结晶产生的热辐射。然后，这是另一个反馈过程，在这种情况下由随机性产生模式，根据晶体底层原子结构的顺序给出一定的规律性。



FORMING ICE PATTERNS
The precise patterns formed by dendritic growth of ice on surfaces are a combination of chance and determinism. In general, the crystals branch repeatedly, but each individual crystal is often seeded by an impurity or defect on the solid surface—so that, for example, they might follow the tracks of almost invisible scratches on glass.
冰型形成
表面上冰的树枝状生长形成的精确图案是机会和决定论的结合。一般来说，晶体反复分支，但每个单独的晶体常常被固体表面上的杂质或缺陷所播种，例如，它们可能跟随玻璃上几乎看不见的划痕。




CRYSTAL RAINBOWS
Some crystals, particularly those of organic compounds such as vitamins and amino acids, have a property called birefringence, which means that light rays passing through them can be split into two. These two beams can then interfere with each other, picking out particular colors from the visible spectrum when the crystals are viewed with polarized light. The spectacular color displays accentuate the shapes and textures of the crystals, which are formed as they grow. The examples shown here are magnesium citrate (1), vitamin C (2), and cholesterol (3).
水晶彩虹
一些晶体，特别是有机化合物，如维生素和氨基酸，有一种称为双折射的性质，这意味着穿过它们的光线可以分裂成两个。然后，这两个光束可以相互干涉，当用偏振光观察晶体时，从可见光谱中挑选出特定的颜色。壮观的彩色显示突出了晶体的形状和纹理，这些晶体是随着它们生长而形成的。这里所示的例子是柠檬酸镁（1）、维生素C（2）和胆固醇（3）。





MOLECULAR MEETINGS
The textures of liquid crystals, revealed by interference of polarized light, are wonderfully varied. Some of the structures in these patterns comes from socalled “defects” where the stacking arrangement of the molecules contains an irregularity—for example, boundaries where sideby-side molecules slant in different directions (like partings in hair) or singularities where molecules radiating in different directions converge at a point (like the crown in hair, or the poles of the Earth’s magnetic field).
分子会议
由偏振光的干涉所揭示的液晶的纹理是非常不同的。这些模式中的一些结构来自所谓的“缺陷”，其中分子的堆叠排列包含不规则性，例如，侧边分子在不同方向上倾斜的边界（如头发中的部分）或分子辐射的奇点。在不同的方向上汇聚在一点（如头发中的冠，或地球磁场的两极）。





1 and 2 THE MANY FACETS OF CRYSTALS
The shapes of crystals often reflect the symmetries of the stacking arrangements for their constituent atoms and molecules. Thus the square shapes of crystals of common salt (1) stem from the cubic arrays of the sodium and chloride ions from which they are made.
Likewise for the rhombusshaped cross-section of magnesium sulfate crystals (2).
1和2晶体的许多方面
晶体的形状通常反映其组成原子和分子的堆叠排列的对称性。因此，普通盐晶体（1）的正方形形状来源于它们所制备的钠和氯离子的立方阵列。
同样地，对于菱形截面的硫酸镁晶体（2）。


3 CHANGE OF STRUCTURE
Here crystals of copper sulfate—the light blue blobs—are embellished with white needlelike crystals, which are also copper sulfate but lack the water molecules that are incorporated into the blue material. This white form grows more quickly and in a different shape.
3结构变化
在这里，硫酸铜晶体的浅蓝色斑点被白色针状晶体点缀，这些晶体也是硫酸铜，但缺少结合在蓝色材料中的水分子。这种白色的形态生长得更快，形状也不同。




HEXAGONAL BRANCHING
Snowflakes seem to provide inexhaustible invention on the hexagonal theme. The branching of arms and hexagonality of the pattern are now well understood, but mysteries remain. It’s not fully obvious why the ice crystals grow as flat plates (other shapes are also possible under different conditions of air temperature and humidity), nor why all the branches are nearly identical. Not all snowflakes are this perfectly symmetrical, however.
六边形分支
雪花似乎为六边形主题提供了无穷的发明。武器的分支和模式的六方性现在已经很好地理解了，但是奥秘仍然存在。冰晶为什么会像平板一样生长（在不同的空气温度和湿度条件下，其他形状也是可能的），也不清楚为什么所有的树枝几乎是相同的。然而，并非所有雪花都是完全对称的。




1 and 2 VIRAL SYMMETRY
Even some biological objects have a crystallike regularity at the molecular scale. Viruses, such as the West Nile virus (1) and simian virus 40 (2), are particularly good examples: they are made of protein molecules packed together in a shell called a capsid, with the genetic material packaged inside. The capsids commonly show fivefold symmetries.
1和2病毒对称性
甚至一些生物对象在分子尺度上也有类似晶体的规律性。病毒，如西尼罗河病毒（1）和猿猴病毒40（2），都是很好的例子：它们是由蛋白质分子包在一起的壳壳中，遗传物质被包装在壳体内。衣壳通常显示五倍对称性。

3 and 4 DISCOVERING ORDER
The atomic-scale order of crystals was first seen directly using techniques called field emission microscopy and field ion microscopy, in which each bright dot (seen here for the metals iridium [3] and platinum [4]) corresponds to a single atom at the surface of a fine tip.
3和4发现顺序
首先使用场发射显微镜和场离子显微镜技术直接看到晶体的原子级顺序，其中每个亮点（在这里看到的金属铱（3）和铂（4））对应于在精细尖端表面的单个原子。

5 X-RAY REVELATION
The most common way to figure out the atomic-scale structure of a crystal is called X-ray diffraction. The interference of X-rays bouncing off different layers of atoms in the crystal creates a series of bright X-ray spots, which can be recorded (originally on photographic film) and decoded mathematically to  deduce where the atoms are. The technique was invented over a hundred years ago, and can now be used to reveal the structures even of complicated biological molecules, such as the enzyme that produced this diffraction pattern. This is how the doublehelix structure of DNA was deduced in 1953.
5 X线透视
确定晶体的原子尺度结构最常用的方法叫做X射线衍射。X射线在晶体中不同层原子的干涉产生了一系列明亮的X射线斑点，它们可以被记录下来（最初在照相胶片上），并在数学上进行解码，从而推断出原子的位置。这项技术是在一百多年前发明的，现在可以用来揭示复杂生物分子的结构，例如产生这种衍射图案的酶。这就是DNA的双螺旋结构是如何在1953推导出来的。




CHEMICAL GARDENS
When crystalline solids are precipitated from dissolved salts in a solution of water glass (sodium silicate), the silicate can form a soft membrane around the growing crystal that dictates its shape, producing bulbous, “organic” structures. Every so often, pressure differences on each side of the membrane may cause it to rupture, releasing jets of solution that crystallize into “branches.” In this way, the crystalline material comes to look more  like a plant form. These structures are commonly called chemical gardens. When this same process is carried out in the narrow space between two flat plates, the crystal structures are more or less two-dimensional, and can take on ornate, curved forms like those shown here, made from a cobalt salt.

当结晶固体从溶解的盐沉淀在水玻璃（硅酸钠）溶液中时，硅酸盐可以在生长的晶体周围形成柔软的膜，它决定其形状，产生球状的“有机”结构。每隔一段时间，膜两侧的压力差会使其破裂，释放出溶液结晶，形成“分支”。这样，晶体材料看起来更像植物形态。这些结构通常被称为化学花园。当在相同的两个平板之间的狭窄空间中进行同样的过程时，晶体结构或多或少是二维的，并且可以采用类似于这里所示的由钴盐制成的华丽、弯曲的形式。



MINERAL FILAMENTS
These are some of the delicate crystal structures produced in the chemical gardens described on page 196. Several different types of crystalline salt are growing in these gardens (not all of which are visible). Each has a characteristic color: copper nitrate (light blue), cobalt chloride (dark blue),ammonium iron sulfate (brown), magnesium nitrate (white), and iron sulfate (green).
矿物长丝
这些是在第196页中描述的化学花园中产生的一些微妙的晶体结构。在这些花园中生长着几种不同类型的结晶盐（并非所有的都是可见的）。每一种都有一种特有的颜色：硝酸铜（淡蓝色）、氯化钴（深蓝）、硫酸铁铵（棕色）、硝酸镁（白色）和硫酸铁（绿）。






1–3 CRYSTAL CAVES
When minerals grow slowly underground from the cooling of warm fluids rich in dissolved salts, the crystals can grow to immense sizes, such as these pillars of selenite (a kind of gypsum) in the Naica mines of Mexico.

8 CRACKS
How things fall apart and how a giant made his staircase
裂缝
事情是如何瓦解的，巨人是如何建造楼梯的


Breakage and decay seem like the very antithesis of order and organization, but surprisingly they too can produce varieties of pattern and structure. In some cases it might not look that way; cracks have a jagged chaos that speaks of wild disarray. But even this form recurs in so many different situations that we have to suspect it is the signature of a deeper design, a universal outcome of natural laws. And other crack patterns, like the trellis of fissures in pottery glaze or old paint, have a pleasing geometry of the same stamp which captivates us in foams, spiders’ webs, and wrinkle textures. We might even seek them out for their aesthetic appeal; cracking, far from being a nuisance, becomes a source of creative opportunity.
断裂和腐烂似乎是秩序和组织的对立物，但令人惊讶的是它们也能产生各种各样的图案和结构。在某些情况下，它可能不是那样的；裂缝有一个锯齿状的混乱，说明了混乱的混乱。但是，即使这种形式出现在许多不同的情况下，我们不得不怀疑它是一个更深层次的设计的标志，是自然法则的普遍结果。而其他裂缝图案，如陶器釉裂缝或旧漆的格子，有一个令人愉快的几何形状相同的邮票，它吸引我们在泡沫，蜘蛛网，和皱纹纹理。我们甚至可以寻找他们的审美吸引力；破裂，远离讨厌，成为一个创造性的机会来源。

Crash! Lightning forks down from the sky. Crack! The ground splits apart in an earthquake. Smash! A pottery jug falls to the floor. All of these events produce similar shapes: branching, jagged, forked, fragmented.
Coincidence? Of course not! The archetypal “geometry of failure”—the shapes that come from things breaking, splitting, cracking—is a fissure that branches, the branch tips splitting into ever more junctions and thereby generating another of nature’s fractal forms. We see these patterns not only in the cracks of a pavement slab, but also in the pattern of river networks—a kind of “slow crack” made as a river’s headwaters erode the landscape in which they form.
These majestic watercourses split apart the earth, carve out mountain ranges, nurture civilizations, and astonish us with their complexity.
The similarity between their shapes and those of the veins that carry blood around the human body was noticed many centuries ago, and stimulated the idea voiced both in ancient China and in Renaissance Europe that rivers are the “blood of the earth.” That’s not just a superficial and misguided pre-scientific analogy: modern science shows that these correspondences in appearance are indeed more than coincidental.
撞车！闪电从天上飞下来。裂开！地震中地面裂开了。粉碎！陶壶掉在地上。所有这些事件产生相似的形状：分支，锯齿状，分叉，碎片化。
巧合？当然不是！原型“失败的几何学”——来自断裂、分裂、开裂的形状是分支的裂缝，分支尖端分裂成越来越多的结，从而产生自然界的另一种分形形式。我们看到这些图案不仅在铺路板的裂缝中，而且在河网的模式中看到，一种“慢裂缝”，就像河流源头侵蚀了它们形成的景观。
这些宏伟的水道分开地球，开拓出山脉，培育文明，震惊了我们与他们的复杂性。
它们的形状和那些带血的人体周围静脉是注意到许多世纪以前之间的相似性，和刺激的思想在古代中国，表示在欧洲文艺复兴时期，河流是地球的“血液”，这不只是一个肤浅和误导D前科学的比喻：现代科学研究表明，这些对应的外观的确比偶然。

Out of action
The explanation for the patterns in both cases may not be so different from that for the simple parabolic path of a golf ball soaring into the air and falling back to the green. But what, you might ask, can the jagged trajectory of water plunging down mountain slopes have in common with the smooth, graceful arc of a ball moving through empty space?
Both are bodies in motion, moving under the force of gravity. For the golf ball, that movement is described by Isaac Newton’s laws of mechanics,which relate the velocity and acceleration of the ball to the forces acting on it. Solve Newton’s equations and you predict the parabola.
But there’s another way to do that reckoning. You can write down a quantity called the action, which depends on the energies of the ball’s motion—its gravitational energy, due to being high in the sky, and its kinetic energy due to its movement. Then, to deduce the ball’s trajectory, you have to figure out which path produces the smallest amount of this quantity called action.
失去作用
对这两种情况的解释可能与高尔夫球的简单抛物线路径不一样，它们是向空中飘落并退回绿色的。但是，你可能会问，山坡上水流颠簸的轨迹会不会像一个球在空旷的空间中流畅、优美的弧线一样？
两个物体都在运动，在重力的作用下移动。对于高尔夫球来说，这种运动是由艾萨克·牛顿的力学定律描述的，它把球的速度和加速度和作用在球上的力联系起来。求解牛顿方程并预测抛物线。
但是还有另一种方法来解决这个问题。你可以写下一个叫做动作的量，它取决于球的运动能量，重力能量，由于天空中的高，以及它的运动所产生的动能。然后，推导出球的轨迹，你必须找出这路径产生最小的数量称为行动。

Think of this as something loosely like “effort.” Which path do you take to go to the store? The one (probably) that requires the least effort.
Which path does the ball take? The one that requires the least action. Just as the “law of least action” defines the parabola of a falling ball, so is there a law of “least something” that defines the path of water flowing down a hill. That “something” is the rate at which the water’s gravitational energy, due to its initial position high up on the slope, is expended and dissipated. This prescription produces a trajectory of water flow that looks just like the fractal network of a river basin. But how does all the water “know” which network dissipation? It doesn’t, of course. If we assume only that the water falls on a randomly bumpy surface and flows down the steepest gradient, and that this flow will, if fast enough, erode and carry away some of the ground, then we find that the pattern of flow spontaneously evolves into a “minimal network.” From simple “local” rules that describe how each little part of the flow behaves, a grand design emerges: the design we see for the Yangtze, the Amazon, the Rhine. Not only does it produce the characteristically branched aerial view of a river basin, but at the same time it wears away a bland, randomly rough landscape into one graced with soaring peaks, plunging precipices, and sharply incized valleys—all from a single generative principle.
把它想象成一个松散的“努力”，你会去哪条路去商店？一个（可能）需要最少的努力。
球走哪条路？需要最少行动的人。正如“最小作用定律”定义了落球的抛物线，所以有一个“最小的东西”定律定义了水下山的路径。“某物”是水的重力能量，由于其初始位置在斜坡上的高度，被消耗和消散。这个处方产生了一个水流的轨迹，看起来就像一个流域的分形网络。但所有的水如何“知道”哪个网络消散？当然不是这样。如果我们假设水落在一个随机的凹凸不平的表面上，并沿着最陡峭的坡度流，并且这个流将足够快地侵蚀和带走一些地面，那么我们发现流动模式自发地从简单的“局部”演变为“最小的网络”。“规则描述了流动的每一个小部分，一个宏伟的设计出现了：我们为Yangtze、亚马逊河、莱茵河所看到的设计。它不仅产生典型的分枝鸟瞰河流流域，但同时穿平淡无奇，随机粗糙景观成一个高耸的山峰，登上悬崖暴跌，大幅incized山谷所有从一个单一的生成原理。

COASTAL EROSION
Erosion by water (sea and surf) sculpts many coastlines into complex, irregular shapes with a fractal structure.
海岸侵蚀
被水侵蚀（海上冲浪）造型很多海岸线到复杂的、有不规则形状的分形结构。


On the edge
There’s not so much difference between a river eroding a mountain and a sea eroding a coastline: in both cases, the energy of the water’s movement batters and abrades the rock, breaking off little particles and carrying them away to carve out a particular shape. And in both cases, a combination of randomness and feedback turns what was once uniform into something pitted, uneven, and fractal.
Coastlines have a special place in the story of fractal patterns, for they were one of the natural forms that prompted Benoit Mandelbrot to come up with the concept of self-similarity, this elaboration on ever smaller scales. And yet it wasn’t until rather recently that a good theory of how coasts get their shape was cooked up. Imagine a coastline that is randomly shaped (remember, that’s not the same as fractal) and where the rock type—and therefore resistance to erosion—varies randomly from place to place.
There’s some gradual and constant erosion as the rocks slowly dissolve in water, and also some fast, sporadic erosion caused by storms.
在边缘
没有河流侵蚀一山一海侵蚀海岸线之间的差异很大：在这两种情况下，水的运动能量和打磨的击球手的岩石，折断的小颗粒和载着他们去开拓出一个特定的形状。而在这两种情况下，组合的随机性和反馈变成曾经统一变成坑坑洼洼，凹凸不平，分形。
海岸线的分形图案的故事中有一个特殊的地方，因为他们是一个自然的形式，促使Benoit Mandelbrot想出了自相似性的概念，阐述在更小的尺度。然而，直到最近，一个好而如何得到其形状理论海岸被煮熟了。想象一个海岸线，是随机形成的（记住，这不是一样的，分形）的岩石类型，因此耐侵蚀性随机变化的地方。
有一些渐进的和持续的侵蚀的岩石慢慢溶解在水中，也有些快，零星的侵蚀引起的风暴。

How does the shape of the coast evolve under these conditions? What begins as random becomes ever more irregular and fractal, as little ever more irregular and fractal, as little dips are hollowed out into big bays while small protrusions are sculpted into jutting headlands. Whether a section of coast is removed depends partly on how strong the rock is, but also on how exposed it is. By the same token, the coastline’s shape feeds back on the ocean forces that generate it: the more convoluted it becomes, the more it disrupts and damps down the waves, slowing the erosion. Out of this complex interplay of effects come structures that resemble the true forms of the land’s end, with their islands, fjords, and peninsulas.
These geological processes of erosion happen over decades, centuries, millennia. Can they have much in common with the kind of breakdown that takes place in the blink of an eye, as a window shatters or a lightning bolt forks through the torpid summer sky? That’s not obvious, and yet the patterns seem to insist on the analogy—for doesn’t lightning take on the same branched, fractal form as a river network?
在这些条件下海岸的形状是如何演变的？从随机开始，变得越来越不规则和分形，几乎没有任何不规则和分形，因为小凹陷被掏空成大海湾，而小突起则被雕刻成凸起的岬角。一段海岸是否被移除，部分取决于岩石的强度，也取决于它是如何暴露的。同样的道理，海岸线的形状又反馈到产生海洋的力量：它变得越卷曲，它越扰乱和减弱波浪，减缓侵蚀。在这种复杂的相互作用中，产生了类似于陆地尽头的真实形态的结构，它们的岛屿、峡湾和半岛。
这些侵蚀的地质过程发生了几十年、几百年、几千年。它们能在眨眼间发生类似的破坏吗？就像一扇窗户碎了，或者闪电穿过夏日的微风？这不是显而易见的，然而，这些模式似乎坚持这样的类比：闪电不是同一条支流的分形形式，就像河网一样吗？

The splitting of a material as high-voltage electricity courses through it is called dielectric breakdown. The pattern of the crack is like a frozen replica of the spark that caused it, and is called a Lichtenberg figure, after the German scientist who first investigated this kind of breakdown. In a three-dimensional block of clear plastic it is like a barren tree or fantastic marine weed, extending its fingers throughout the material. Here is a real marriage of lightning and cracking, a substance split by electricity into a rich record of fractal failure. Can we account for it?
Imagine dumping a dollop of electrical charge into the center of a slab of material, so that it wants to flow out to the edges as the charged particles repel one another. Which path does the flow of electricity take?
Like water on a hillslope, it seeks out the steepest gradient; that’s to say, it will advance from wherever the electric field at the boundary of the discharge is strongest. And those places are where the boundary is the sharpest: at bulges and tips. That’s why lightning conductors on buildings are sharp spikes: they encourage the electrical discharge to happen there.
This forward surge of a tip is complicated by randomness—by little chance fluctuations in the electric field or in the material’s structure that can generate new bumps that themselves then rapidly sprout into a new tip. So the tips split as they advance, and the result is a treelike, branching form.
将材料劈开作为高压电的过程被称为电介质击穿。裂纹的模式就像是一个引起它的火花的冷冻复制品，被称为Ligtnigg图形，在德国科学家首次研究了这种击穿之后。在一个三维的透明塑料块中，它像一棵贫瘠的树或奇妙的海草，在整个材料中伸展手指。这是一个真正的闪电和破裂的婚姻，一个由电分裂成丰富的分形破坏记录的物质。我们能解释一下吗？
想象一下，把一大堆电荷扔进一块材料的中心，这样它就想在带电粒子互相排斥时向边缘流动。电力流走哪条路？
就像山坡上的水一样，它寻找最陡峭的坡度；也就是说，它会从放电边界处的电场最强的地方前进。这些地方是边界最锋利的地方：凸起和尖端。这就是为什么建筑物上的闪电导体是尖峰的原因：它们鼓励放电发生在那里。
尖端的正向浪涌是由随机性复杂的，因为电场或材料结构中的小的偶然波动会产生新的凸点，然后它们会迅速萌生成新的尖端。所以尖端随着它们的前进而分裂，结果是树状的、分支的形式。

Depending on the atmospheric conditions, this elaboration of a lightning bolt can create dramatic,spectacular, natural rivers of electricity.
This description of dielectric breakdown can be modified to account for cracking, too. Here, instead of thinking about the path of the electrical current, we think of the path opened up by breakage of the material. Again that breakage is most likely at the crack tips, because this time it is the stress that is greatest at the tip. And once more, randomness—variations in the strength of the material, say, or pre-existing little cracks and flaws—induces tip-splitting and branching.
根据大气条件，这种闪电的制作可以创造出引人注目、壮观、自然的电力河流。
这种介电击穿的描述也可以被修改以解释开裂。这里，我们不考虑电流的路径，而是考虑材料断裂所造成的路径。同样，断裂最有可能在裂纹尖端，因为这次是尖端处最大的应力。再一次，材料强度的随机性变化，例如，或预先存在的小裂纹和缺陷引起尖端分裂和分支。


DEATH VALLEY, USA
When mud lying on the bottom of a dried-up lake becomes dry and shrinks as water is removed from between the fine particles, stresses build up that lead eventually to cracking. The patterns are a fine balance of order and disorder. The cracks may be jagged, but they divide up the dry layer into islands that have roughly the same size and are often approximately polygonal in shape. This pattern is typically the one that is most efficient at relieving the stresses in the contracting material.
美国死亡谷
当干涸的湖泊底部的泥浆变得干燥和收缩时，细颗粒之间的水被去除，应力导致最终导致破裂。这些模式是秩序和混乱的完美平衡。裂纹可能是锯齿状的，但它们将干燥层分成大小大致相同且形状近似多边形的岛屿。这种模式通常是最有效地缓解收缩材料中的应力的模式。


Crazy paving
If a lake dries up, or if the moist soil of a pasture or garden becomes parched, the ground contracts as the water evaporates from between the soil particles. This means that the dry layer at the surface tries to shrink relative to the still-moist layer below, and the ground becomes laced with tension throughout. Then the surface breaks apart not with the appearance of a single, branching crack but by the formation of an interconnected network of fissures that split it into isolated islands.
These patterns, so familiar as a kind of pictorial shorthand for tales of drought, are rather beautiful.
They are also quite different from the fractal networks of dielectric breakdown and river erosion.
疯狂铺路
如果湖泊干涸，或者牧场或花园潮湿的土壤变得干涸，土壤就在土壤颗粒之间蒸发而收缩。这意味着表面上的干层相对于下面的潮湿层试图收缩，并且整个地面变得紧张。然后，表面破裂而不是单个分支裂缝的出现，而是形成裂缝的相互连接的网络，将裂缝分裂成孤立的岛屿。
这些图案，作为一种关于干旱故事的速记图案，非常熟悉。
它们与介电击穿和河流侵蚀的分形网络也有很大的不同。

The islands often have a polygonal shape defi ned by their fl at edges, although sometimes the edges are less smooth and more erratic. The crack lines intersect rather cleanly, usually at relatively large angles of around 60–90o. There is a universal character to these patterns, too: we recognize them not just in dried-up lake beds but in pottery glazes such as raku and in the fl aking of paint. The driving force is much the same in all cases: the glaze, say, bound to the ceramic surface, cracks as it cools and contracts. The result is so pleasing that in pottery it may be induced on purpose.
What dictates this artful geometry? It seems again to be governed by a minimization rule: the cracks take paths that release the stress in the shrinking layer as effectively as possible.
In glazes this happens when the cracks meet at right-angle junctions, and so the cracks are shaped and positioned to enable this, even if it means that one crack must bend as it approaches another.
岛上经常有一个多边形，定义由佛罗里达州的边缘，虽然有时边缘欠光滑和更不稳定。裂纹线相交而干净，通常在比较大的角度在60–90o。有一个普遍的特征：我们认识到这些模式，他们不只是在干涸的湖床在陶器釉如乐和油漆的佛罗里达州以。在所有的情况下，驱动力是一样的：釉，说，绑定到陶瓷表面，因为它冷却并收缩裂缝。结果是让人赏心悦目，陶可诱导的目的。
是什么决定了这种巧妙的几何学？似乎又是由一个最小化原则：裂缝采取的路径，释放压力在收缩层尽可能有效。
在釉料中这发生在当裂纹遇到直角连接，因此裂纹的形状和位置使这个，即使这意味着一个裂纹必须当它接近一个弯。

Stress-relieving crack networks carve out some of nature’s most spectacular fracture patterns: the hexagonal pillars of rock found at Fingal’s Cave off the coast of Scotland, the Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, and the Devil’s Postpile in California. How nature can produce formations so seemingly ordered, geometrical, almost designed, has perplexed scientists and philosophers for centuries. It isn’t hard to understand how these patterns, just like the hexagonal perfection of the bee’s honeycomb, must have convinced scientists and naturalists of earlier ages that they were seeing the work of the divine—or the supernatural.
Fingal’s Cave was traditionally said to have been part of an immense paved causeway across the North Channel above the Irish Sea, stretching from Ireland to Scotland and built by the Irish giant Finn  MacCool (Fingal) so that he could stride across to fight a rival Scottish giant. This bridge, it was said, began in County Antrim, where today the Giant’s Causeway stands on the wild coast.
These geological formations were created as volcanic rock surged to the planet’s surface and hardened around 60 million years ago. Why the stresses induced by cooling and contraction of the molten rock should have generated so orderly a system of fissures puzzled scientists for a long time.
应力释放裂缝网络挖掘出一些自然界最壮观的裂缝模式：在苏格兰海岸的Fingal洞穴发现的岩石的六边形柱子，北爱尔兰的巨型堤道，以及加利福尼亚的魔鬼桩。大自然如何能产生看似有序、几何、几乎被设计的地层，使科学家和哲学家困惑了几个世纪。不难理解这些模式，就像蜜蜂蜂巢的六边形完美，必须让早期科学家和博物学家相信他们看到的是神圣或超自然的工作。
传统上说，Fingal的山洞是爱尔兰海北部通道上方的一条巨大铺设的堤道的一部分，从爱尔兰延伸到苏格兰，由爱尔兰巨人芬恩麦克库尔（Fingal）建造，这样他就可以跨过去与一个与之竞争的苏格兰巨人作战。这座桥，它是说，开始在安特里姆县，在今天的巨人站在狂野海岸。
这些地质层由火山岩上升到地球表面硬化，大约6000万年前。为什么应力引起的冷却的熔岩收缩应该产生如此整洁的裂隙系统困惑科学家很长时间。



A GIANT’S WORK
At Fingal’s Cave on the Isle of Staffa, Scotland,networks of cracks growing downward through a layer of cooling and solidifying basalt have become highly regular, almost geometric, so that they break up the rock into these prism-shaped columns, typically with six sides and a roughly hexagonal cross-section.
巨人的作品
在苏格兰斯塔法岛岛的芬加尔洞穴中，通过一层冷却和凝固玄武岩层向下生长的裂缝网络变得非常规则，几乎是几何的，因此它们将岩石分解成棱柱状的柱状物，通常有六个边和大致六角形的CRO。SS部分。


“Stress-relieving crack networks carve out some of nature’s most spectacular fracture patterns.”
“应力释放裂纹网络挖掘出自然界最壮观的断裂模式。”


The key issue is that here nature gets time to experiment and refine the arrangement of cracks so as to gradually find the “best” (and most orderly) answer. Cracking appears first at the surface of the cooling rock, since it is here that the heat escapes most quickly and the molten material begins to harden. At first, the stresses that build up in the solid layer are relieved by fractures appearing more or less at random points, and the network looks rather jumbled. But as the cracks descend through the solidifying mass, the network adjusts to release stress more effectively.
That happens when these cracks intersect in threes, with roughly equal angles between each of them—in other words, so that the junctions have the 120˚ angles characteristic of a honeycombshaped network of hexagons.
关键的问题是，这里的自然有时间来实验和完善裂缝的安排，以便逐步找到“最佳”（最有序的）答案。裂纹首先出现在冷却岩石的表面，因为在这里热量逸出最快，熔融材料开始硬化。起初，在固体层中建立的应力被随机点出现或多或少的裂缝减轻，并且网络看起来相当混乱。但是当裂纹通过凝固质量下降时，网络调节以更有效地释放应力。
发生这种情况时，这些裂缝相交三大致相等的角之间的每个人在其他的话，这样的路口有120˚角一honeycombshaped网络六边形特征。

That’s different from the case of a thin layer of glaze hardening on the surface of a pot, or of mud on a lake bed. For one thing, the cracks now are not just weaving horizontally across a flat layer, but are also descending through a thick slab of material as it cools or hardens. What’s more, the pattern isn’t constrained by the initial appearance of a few very long, smooth cracks, as it is in the glaze. For such reasons, hexagonal junctions are preferred over the right-angle junctions of raku. It’s the same basic idea—how best to release stress caused by shrinkage—but the solution is different.
这是不同的从一层薄釉硬化在锅表面的情况下，或在湖底泥。首先，裂缝现在不仅仅是编织横向平层，但也降下厚厚的一层物质遇冷或变硬。更重要的是，模式没有用一些很长的、平滑的初始裂纹出现的约束，因为它是在釉。因此，六路口优先在该直角接头。基本上是同样的想法如何最好的释放引起的收缩应力，但解决方案是不同的。
So as the crack network penetrates deeper down, it grows ever closer to an ideal honeycomb pattern. It never achieves that shape perfectly (many of the columns of the Giant’s Causeway are rather irregular hexagons, and some have five or seven sides), because there’s almost always a bit of disorder and randomness in the way nature makes its patterns. But the result is close enough to geometric perfection to astonish us.
The topmost layers of the rock formation are far less orderly—but these will have been removed long ago by erosion. What now remains is one of the most striking tributes to the self-organizing powers of the natural world.
因此，裂纹网络越深越深，越接近理想的蜂窝图案。它从来没有完美地达到这个形状（巨人的堤道的许多柱子都是不规则六边形，有些有五条或七条边），因为自然界的模式几乎总是有一点混乱和随机性。但是结果足够接近几何完美让我们吃惊。
岩层的最顶层远不那么有序，但这些将很早以前就被侵蚀掉了。现在剩下的是对自然世界自组织能力的最强烈的贡品之一。


1 CRACKS IN WOOD
In old, dead trees, cracks caused by stresses in the dry and contracting wood radiate from the center, but they are also deflected sideways at the boundaries between different seasonal growth la yers (the tree rings), where the wood fabric is relatively weaker.

2 GLAZED OVER
The network of cracks in pottery glaze is again caused by cooling and shrinkage of a thin layer, which sets up stresses. Here the process starts with some long, gently curving cracks, which are then interconnected by shorter cracks that generally join at right angles, producing polygonal islands.

1 and 2 FAMILIAR FORKING
The idea that river and stream networks are a kind of “breakdown” or cracking pattern becomes clear once we compare an example like this one, a stream from an Icelandic spring (1), with the forked network of a lightning strike (2). Lightning is an instance of so-called “dielectric breakdown,” when an electrical discharge passes through a normally insulating substance, in this case air.
1和2熟悉分叉
一旦我们比较一个例子，如冰岛泉（1）的水流，和闪电的分叉网络（2），河流和溪流网络是一种“崩溃”或破裂模式的想法就变得清晰了。闪电是所谓的“电介质击穿”的例子，当放电通过正常绝缘物质，在这种情况下，空气。

1 LAVA CRACKS
The initial stages in the formation of the Giant’s Causeway probably looked a bit like this—a crack network forming in the crust of molten lava. The islands here are rather more diverse in size and shape than the polygons of the Giant’s Causeway, but it’s thought that the crack network gradually reorganized itself as it penetrated deeper to become more regular. The irregular top layers were then removed by millions of years of erosion.
1熔岩裂缝
巨石堤形成的初始阶段可能看起来有点像一个在熔融熔岩壳中形成的裂隙网络。这里的岛屿在大小和形状上比巨型堤道的多边形要多样化得多，但是人们认为裂缝网络随着深度的加深而逐渐重组，从而变得更加规则。不规则的顶层随后被岁月的侵蚀数百万删除。

2 and 3 FLAKING PAINT
As paint dries, the pigment particles are pulled closer together and the film cracks. The process is very similar to the cooling of a glaze film in pottery, and the pattern looks much the same, too.
2和3剥落漆
油漆干燥，色素颗粒被紧密地联系在一起，这部电影的裂缝。这个过程是在陶瓷釉膜冷却非常相似，和图案看起来是一样的，太。




BRANCHING LIGHTNING
The forked branches of lightning are the result of another growth instability. As the electrical discharge passes through the air between the thundercloud and the ground, any small and random bumps at the tip become quickly amplified into a new branch, because the gradient of the electric field (how steeply the field changes over a given distance) is larger there and so the current is more likely to flow that way.
As is the case for many patterns that experience these branching instabilities, the structure that results is a fractal.
分支闪电
分叉的闪电分支是另一个生长不稳定的结果。当放电穿过雷云和地面之间的空气时，尖端上的任何小的和随机的凸起都会迅速被放大成新的分支，因为电场的梯度（电场在给定距离上的急剧变化）在那里更大，因此C。水流更可能这样流动。
对于经历这些分支不稳定性的许多模式来说，结果是一个分形结构。

CRACKED CRUST
Cracks may occur at geological scales, spreading over many miles through the Earth’s crust in earthquake zones where the movements of tectonic plates create stresses in the hard rock. Such faults, like the San Andreas Fault in California shown here, are often relatively straight and unbranched. They are cracks that extend deep into the crust.
裂隙地壳
裂缝可能发生在地质尺度上，在地球地壳中延伸很多英里，在地震带中，构造板块的运动在坚硬岩石中产生应力。像加利福尼亚的圣安德烈亚斯断层这样的断层通常是相对直的和不分枝的。它们是延伸到地壳深处的裂缝。




RIVER NETWORKS
These highly branched systems have more diverse and often more sinuous shapes than cracks in brittle material. That’s because the pattern is produced from several processes operating at the same time, such as erosion and deposition of sediment (which combine to create river meanders). The shape might also depend on local differences in the strength and chemical nature of the underlying rock.
河网
这些高度支化的系统比脆性材料裂纹更多样和更复杂的形状。这是因为模式是从几个进程同时运行产生，如侵蚀和沉积泥沙（这些创造河蜿蜒）。形状也可能取决于当地的差异在强度和化学的基础岩石性质。

1 and 2 VISCOUS FINGERING
In this phenomenon, a less viscous fluid (such as air) is pushed or pulled under pressure into a more viscous one. When this happens, the boundary between the two fluids is subject to another branching growth instability: at any protrusion, the pressure in the invading fluid is greater, so it surges forward in a narrowing finger. Patterns like this are formed when a film of sticky fluid, like an adhesive or paint, between two flat plates is disrupted by pulling the plates apart, sucking air into the gap. The result is a tracery of fine channels, looking a bit like river networks (1). In some cases the fingering instabilty can be tempered by the force of surface tension, which acts to smooth a branch tip and make it less sharp.
Then the pattern can become a series of thicker branches (2).
1和2粘性指进
这一现象，少粘性流体（如空气）推或拉的压力下变成更多的粘性。当这种情况发生时，两流体之间的边界是受另一个分枝生长不稳定：在任何突起，在入侵的流体的压力更大，所以它奔腾在小指。这样的样式时形成的膜粘性流体，如粘合剂或涂料的两平板之间是通过拉板分开打乱，吸入空气间隙。其结果是一个花纹精细的渠道，看起来有点像河流网络（1）。在某些情况下，指法instabilty可以通过表面张力的力量锻炼，可以顺利的一个分支，并使它不锋利的尖。
然后模式可以成为一个系列的较粗的枝条（2）。



3 SINKING PLUMES
As a more dense fluid sinks through a less dense one, the blobs of the denser liquid split into fingers, which then split again and again, creating an inverted branching tree shape.
This, too, is a process of viscous fingering,and can occur in the oceans when colder or saltier water sinks through warmer or fresher water below.
3沉羽
当一个更稠密的流体通过一个不那么致密的流体下沉时，稠密液体的斑点分裂成手指，然后再次分裂，产生倒置的分支树形状。
这也是粘性指进的过程，当较冷或咸水通过较温暖或较新鲜的水下沉时，会发生在海洋中。

9 SPOTS & STRIPES
How the zebra paints its coat
9点斑纹
斑马如何涂上外套

Rudyard Kipling explained in his Just So Stories how the leopard got its spots and the zebra its stripes. His answers were wholly fanciful, but at that time scientists could do little better. It was one thing to explain why animals have markings—for camouflage, for example—but quite another to explain how that comes about as the creature grows. The explanation now widely accepted is that these patterns are produced in a process of self-organization that also operates in very different kinds of natural phenomena. It finds analogies in the way sand ripples form or animals arrange their nests in colonies. In other words the description is, in the end, a mathematical one that doesn’t depend on biological particulars, even if it is adapted and fine-tuned by natural selection.
吉卜林在他的故事中解释了豹是如何获得斑点和斑马条纹的。他的回答完全是荒诞不经的，但那时科学家们做得更好。例如，解释动物为什么有伪装的标记是一回事，但解释动物生长的原因是另一回事。现在广泛接受的解释是，这些模式是在自组织的过程中产生的，它们也以非常不同的自然现象运作。它发现类比的方式，沙波纹形成或动物安排他们的巢在殖民地。换句话说，描述的是，在最后，一个数学一个不依赖于生物的细节，即使是适应和自然选择的调整好。

Animals are exquisite masters of pattern, but they seem to follow particular fashions. The stripes of the zebra are a popular design: as you’d guess, the zebrafish has the same idea, and so does the angelfish, the tiger, some antelopes, frogs, caterpillars, and other creatures. Another favorite is spots, sported by the leopard, the spotted eagle ray, the ladybird, and the red spotted toad. Butterflies seem to recognize no limits: their patterns are dazzling, sumptuous, and seemingly endless.
It’s not always easy to say what these patterns are for. The usual assumption among biologists and zoologists is that, if evolution has gone to the trouble of making an animal patterned, there’s a reason for it that somehow works to the animal’s advantage: in other words, it is a Darwinian adaptation that helps the creature to survive and therefore to reproduce. Maybe it’s a warning signal to fool or deter predators. Or perhaps it helps members of the same species to recognize each other, or to impress the opposite sex in mating displays.
But although it seems likely that most markings do have an adaptive function like this,we can’t always be sure what that function is.
动物是图案的精湛大师，但它们似乎遵循着特定的时尚。斑马条纹是一种流行的设计：正如你猜的那样，斑马鱼有着同样的想法，天使鱼、老虎、羚羊、青蛙、毛毛虫和其他生物也是如此。另一个喜欢的是斑点，被豹、斑点鹰射线、瓢虫和红斑点蟾蜍所感染。蝴蝶似乎没有任何限制：它们的图案是耀眼的，华丽的，似乎无止境的。
说这些模式的目的并不总是很容易。生物学家和动物学家的通常假设是，如果进化到了使动物图案化的麻烦，有一个原因，它对动物的优势起作用：换句话说，这是达尔文适应，帮助生物生存，因此T。复制。也许这是一种愚弄或阻止捕食者的警告信号。或许它可以帮助同一物种的成员认识对方，或者在交配展示中给异性留下深刻印象。
但是，尽管大多数标记似乎都具有这样的自适应函数，但我们不能总是确定该函数是什么。

Evolutionary “explanations” for markings may come all too easily; evidence for them is harder. Take the zebra. It seems obvious that the stripes must help it to hide in the shadows, right?
But zebras spend most of their time on open grassland, not among trees and bushes. And if stripes help you hide from predators like lions,why don’t all their prey have them? The zebra’s stripes might not be a form of camouflage at all, but could deter biting flies, or regulate body heat,or something else. We just don’t know. It’s the same story with wild cats; it’s true that there are more spotty and mottled ones in habitats that create a mottled, patchy background, but there are exceptions, too.
And even if these patterns on skins, pelts, and scales do have some evolutionary function, that doesn’t completely answer the question of where they come from. How does any particular zebra embryo get imprinted with stripes of pigmentproducing skin cells, which produce dark hairs in some places but not in others? Until half a century ago, we had no idea. But now we do—for spots and stripes can be created by clever chemistry.
对标记的进化“解释”可能太容易了；对它们的证据更难。以斑马为例。显然，条纹必须帮助它隐藏在阴影中，对吧？
但是斑马大部分时间都呆在开阔的草地上，而不是在树和灌木丛中。如果条纹可以帮助你躲避像狮子这样的掠食者，为什么它们的猎物不都有它们呢？斑马的条纹可能不是伪装的形式，但可以阻止咬苍蝇，或调节体温，或其他东西。我们只是不知道。野生猫科动物的故事也是一样的，在生境中有更多的斑点和斑驳的斑点，会产生斑驳斑驳的背景，但也有例外。
即使皮肤、皮毛和鳞片上的这些图案确实具有某种进化功能，但它们并不能完全回答它们来自何处的问题。任何特定斑马胚胎如何印有条纹产生色素的皮肤细胞，在某些地方产生黑头发，而不是在其他地方产生黑头发？直到半个世纪前，我们还不知道。但现在我们要做的是斑点和条纹可以用巧妙的化学方法创造出来。

Breaking out in pattern
The British mathematician Alan Turing offered the first theory of how animal patterns are formed.
Turing is best known for his work on the notion of programmable computers and for his codebreaking exploits for the Allies at Bletchley Park during World War II, now made famous by the movie The Imitation Game. But his inquisitive mind took him down all kinds of paths, and in 1952 he described a theory of how embryos develop from a simple, spherical egg into a patterned body with organs and limbs. That question led Turing to discover one of the most lovely and versatile patterning processes in nature.
Turing imagined the embryo as a ball of cells full of biochemical ingredients that are drifting through the cell liquid and reacting with each other to turn on or off genes that control how particular cells will develop. He showed how such a soup of chemicals could spontaneously lose the blandness of a uniform mixture and adopt a patchy structure, with more of certain ingredients in some places than in others.
模式突破
英国数学家Alan Turing提出了动物模式形成的第一个理论。
图灵最著名的是他对可编程计算机概念的研究，以及他在二战期间在布莱切利公园的盟军破坏者的发明，现在这部电影以模仿游戏闻名。但是他好奇的头脑让他走上了各种各样的道路，1952他描述了一个理论，即胚胎是如何从一个简单的球形蛋发展成具有器官和四肢的有图案的身体。这个问题导致图灵发现了自然界中最可爱和多用途的图解过程之一。
图灵把胚胎想象成一个充满生化成分的细胞球，它们通过细胞液体漂流并相互反应，打开或关闭控制特定细胞发育的基因。他展示了这样的化学汤如何会自发地失去均匀混合物的平淡，并采用一种斑驳的结构，在某些地方比其他地方含有更多的成分。


The key is feedback. What if, Turing said, some chemical reactions make substances that speed up the reaction that actually produces them—if they are, in other words, auto-catalysts? This can create a runaway effect, in which tiny, chance fluctuations in the concentration of the ingredients can become blown up into big differences, so that the mixture becomes spontaneously patchy.
On their own, auto-catalysts would multiply until they overwhelm the whole mixture. But in Turing’s soup there were two kinds of ingredients, which he called morphogens (“shape formers”). Today researchers call one of these an activator, since it is auto-catalytic and boosts its own production,and the other an inhibitor, since it suppresses this self-amplifying growth of the activator. Molecules of the two components spread through the mixture like ink in water, but in Turing’s scheme the inhibitor spreads faster than the activator. When he wrote down and solved the equations describing this activator-inhibitor scheme, Turing found that blobs of activator may grow in some places, more or less at random, but constrained within little islands, separated by the effect of the inhibitor. He remarked that they looked like the dappled markings on some animals. Later, when Turing’s equations could be solved by computer, it became clear that they generally produce two types of pattern: arrays of spots and stripes, all about the same size and spaced by the same distance, and arranged in a more or less orderly fashion. We now know that Turing’s chemical patterns are a variation on the reaction-diffusion schemes described in Chapter 5, which generate chemical waves. In Turing’s theory, the waves are “frozen” in place; they are stationary.
关键是反馈。如果Turing说，有些化学反应会使物质加速反应，如果它们是自动催化剂的话，会产生什么样的反应？这会产生一种失控的效应，在这种情况下，成分浓度的微小波动会被吹成大的差异，从而使混合物自发地变得片状。
就其自身而言，汽车催化剂会不断增加，直到它们压垮整个混合物。但在图灵汤中，有两种成分，他称之为形态发生素（“形状成型器”）。今天，研究人员将其中的一种称为活化剂，因为它是自动催化和促进自身生产的，而另一种是抑制剂，因为它抑制了激活剂的这种自放大生长。两种组分的分子在水中像油墨一样扩散，但在图灵的方案中，抑制剂比活化剂扩散得快。当他写下了描述这种激活物抑制剂方案的方程，图灵发现斑点激活可能在某些地方生长，或多或少随意，但限制在小小的岛屿，由抑制剂的分离效果。他说，他们喜欢看一些动物斑纹的标记。后来，当图灵方程式可以由计算机来解决，它变得清晰，他们普遍产生的两种模式：斑点和条纹阵列，大小差不多，间隔相同的距离，排列在或多或少有序。我们现在知道，图灵的化学模式是对5章所述的反应扩散方案的变化，产生化学波。在图灵的理论，这波“冻结”的地方；他们是静止的。

Whether or not Turing’s theory told us anything about how embryos grow, it seemed to offer a good explanation for how animal markings—the spots of the leopard and the stripes of a zebra—form. The idea is that there are biochemical morphogens produced in the skins of these creatures as they develop in the womb, which drift from cell to cell acting like Turing’s activator and inhibitor. Where there’s a lot of the activator, it can throw a genetic switch to turn on pigment production, and the pattern gets laid down in the embryo. As the animal grows, the pattern expands.
It wasn’t until 1990 that researchers in France succeeded in making Turing patterns experimentally in a mixture of chemicals. Today there are various chemical recipes for making a wide range of Turing patterns based on spots and stripes. Some are almost crystallike in their regularity, while others are fabulous jumbled labyrinths. With some care in arranging the initial distribution of the activator and inhibitor, you can make a vast galaxy of different patterns.
无论图灵的理论是否告诉我们胚胎如何生长，它似乎提供了一个很好的解释，说明动物的斑纹和斑马的斑纹是如何形成的。这个想法是，这些生物在皮肤中产生的生化形态发生在子宫中，它们从细胞迁移到细胞，就像Turing的激活剂和抑制剂一样。在有很多激活剂的情况下，它可以引发一个基因开关来开启色素产生，而这种模式在胚胎中形成。随着动物的生长，图案扩张。
直到1990，法国的研究人员才成功地在化学混合物中制作图灵图案。今天有各种各样的化学配方，用于制作基于斑点和条纹的图灵图案。有些在其规律性上几乎是晶体状的，而另一些则是错综复杂的迷宫。在安排激活剂和抑制剂的初始分布时要注意，你可以形成一个巨大的不同模式的星系。

Animal tales
Since the 1980s, researchers have shown how mathematical models of biochemical pigment patterning using Turing’s ideas can produce the variety of markings we see in real animals. Zebrastyle stripes are fairly easy to make, but many markings are more complicated. The leopard’s spots, for example, are a little like clusters of fingerprints—not a single dark splodge, but groups of perhaps four or five blobs arranged like black petals around a central brownish patch. The jaguar’s spots are still more complex: dark rings with a few little blobs in the center. And the giraffe doesn’t so much have dark spots as an entirely dark pelt threaded by a network of unpigmented hairs, a bit like the pattern of cracks in dry mud.
这些动物
researchers have shown the 1980s以来，如何利用数学模型对生化颜料patterning图灵的想法，可以产生markings in the variety of我们看到真实的动物。如果您发现有错误，请尽管发表评论！The leopard ' s spos，for example，are a little like like chlusters of fingeirley - not a single dark splodge，but groups of perhaps four or five blobs arranged like black petals around a central Brownish Patch .美洲豹的斑点are still more complex with a few：暗环的小斑点，in the中心。and the长颈鹿不那么暗斑有黑暗的毛皮as an entirely by a Network of线程无颜料的头发，点像in the pattern of精锐干泥。

With a bit of ingenuity, all of these patterns can be generated by Turing-type activatorinhibitor processes, although sometimes they need more than two ingredients. What’s more, these mathematical models can explain how the patterns depend on the shapes of the bodies they cover. Spots on a large patch of fur, for example, might turn into stripelike bands on a tapering tail, as they do for some wildcats. Whether ladybird species have spots or stripes, and how big they are, may depend on how curved their domelike wing-covering shells are. And the mathematical models can mimic the kind of “unzipping” of stripes seen on the angelfish as it grows.
有一点独创性，所有这些模式都可以由图灵型Ac激活抑制器过程生成，尽管有时它们需要多于两种成分。更重要的是，这些数学模型可以解释模式如何取决于它们所覆盖的物体的形状。例如，在一大块毛皮上的斑点可能会变成尾巴上的条纹状带，就像一些野猫一样。瓢虫物种是否有斑点或条纹，以及它们有多大，可能取决于它们的穹顶状翅膀覆盖的壳是多么弯曲。数学模型可以模拟天使鱼在生长时看到的条纹的“解压缩”。

After reading Turing’s paper on chemical patterns, the eminent biologist Conrad Waddington wrote to Turing to suggest that his theory might explain butterfly wing patterns. With their array of spots, stripes, chevrons, and other shapes, they seem like an obvious candidate.
But it now appears that the process here is more complicated, involving a delicate interplay between diffusing biochemicals that act rather like morphogens, the vein structure of the wings themselves, and the complex genetic mechanisms that control the organism’s development. In other words, they aren’t exactly Turing patterns, but they are probably related. The idea is that the butterfly wing contains various “sources” and “sinks” of the morphogens— places where they are produced and destroyed, ultimately controlled by “patterning genes.” Depending on how these sources and sinks are arranged, all the common pattern elements in butterfly wings can be mimicked in mathematical models.
在阅读图灵关于化学图案的论文之后，杰出的生物学家Conrad Waddington写信给图灵，建议他的理论可以解释蝴蝶翅膀的图案。他们的斑点，条纹，雪佛龙和其他形状，他们似乎是一个明显的候选人。
但现在看来，这里的过程更为复杂，涉及扩散的生物化学物质之间的微妙相互作用，其作用相当于形态发生素、翅膀自身的静脉结构以及控制生物体发育的复杂遗传机制。换句话说，它们不是精确的图灵图案，但它们可能是相关的。蝴蝶翅膀中含有各种各样的“源”和“下沉”的形态发生——它们被产生和破坏的地方，最终被“图案化基因控制”。翅膀可以模仿数学模型。


All this is a good sign that Turing’s process for producing animal markings is on the right track, but it’s not yet proof that the idea is right.
To prove it, we would need to find the actual biochemicals that act as morphogens of pattern formation. No one has yet managed to do that for pigment patterns. There is, however, pretty good evidence that several other biological patterns are made by the same kind of activator-inhibitor process: for example, the regularly spaced hair follicles of mice (and perhaps ours, too), the series of parallel barbs in bird feathers, the dunelike ridges in the mouth palate of mammals,and the stripelike segmentation of hands and feet in mammal embryos that leads eventually to the formation of the fingers and toes. It’s possible that something like a Turing process of reaction and diffusion of morphogens happens in plants, too, where it might produce the regular arrangements of leaves around a stem or florets and seeds in a flower head (see Chapter 3). That’s a possibility that Turing himself foresaw.
And Turing’s patterns might reach further still, into whole communities of organisms. The basic ingredients are, after all, quite simple: you need a process that amplifies itself by positive feedback and another process that inhibits this, both of which must spread throughout the system at different rates. Given these elements, the patterns that emerge are likely to be more or less the same in every case. In the semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East, you can find grass covering the dry ground in labyrinthine patches that look like the convoluted designs seen on some fish.
所有这一切都表明图灵生产动物标识的过程是正确的，但还不能证明这个想法是正确的。
为了证明这一点，我们需要找到作为模式形成的形态发生的实际生物化学物质。至今还没有人能做到这一点的颜料图案。然而，很好的证据表明，其他几种生物模式是由同一种活化剂抑制剂过程所产生的：例如，老鼠（也可能是我们的）的规则间隔的毛囊，在鸟类羽毛中的一系列平行倒刺，嘴里的沙丘状脊。哺乳动物的腭，哺乳动物胚胎中手足的条纹状分裂，最终导致手指和脚趾的形成。在植物中也可能发生类似于图灵反应和扩散的图灵过程，在那里它可能产生围绕茎或小花的叶子的排列，并在花头中产生种子（见第3章）。这是图灵自己预见的可能性。
图灵的模式可能会进一步深入到整个生物群落中。毕竟，基本的成分很简单：你需要一个通过正反馈放大自身的过程和另一个抑制这一过程的过程，这两个过程都必须以不同的速率在整个系统中传播。考虑到这些因素，出现的模式在每种情况下或多或少都是相同的。在非洲和中东的半干旱地区，你可以发现在干燥的土地上覆盖着迷宫般的斑块，就像一些鱼上看到的卷曲的图案。

The grassy patches are sustained by their ability to capture the water flowing over the land after rare bursts of rain: a clump of grass can accumulate run-off water at the cost of depriving the ground around it. A mathematical model of this process suggests that on sloping ground where the flow goes one way, the result should be stripes of vegetation, whereas on flat ground the flow is controlled more by random little topographical bumps and the pattern is more spotty. These models also predict—and observations of nature seem to confirm it—that the pattern can change from spots to interweaving stripes to carpets punctured by holes of bare ground, as the amount of rainfall increases.
草地上的斑块是由它们捕捉罕见雨水后在陆地上流动的水的能力来维持的：一丛草可以以消耗掉周围的土地为代价来积聚径流水。这一过程的数学模型表明，在坡面上的流动是单向的，结果应该是植被条带，而在平坦的地面上，流动受到随机的小地形凸起更多的控制，并且图案更加斑点。这些模型还预测和观察自然，似乎可以证实，随着降雨量的增加，图案可以从斑点到交织的条纹变为被裸露地面孔刺破的地毯。

在热带海洋中发现的一种海洋螺旋体，这种圣诞树蠕虫有一个华丽而几乎在数学上有规律的设计。这种有组织的结构是如何在生物体中出现的？


The self-organized world
Turing’s theory has been proposed as an explanation for patterns as diverse as the arrangement of “ant cemeteries” (where ants deposit the dead bodies of their peers), the arrangements of sand ripples in deserts, and the patchiness of plankton communities in the oceans and of crime incidence in cities. It seems likely to be one of nature’s universal principles for converting bland uniformity to interesting, sometimes useful, often beautiful patchiness. It’s not too fanciful to say that it is a means by which nature exercises her creativity.
And it’s a classic example of self-organization: how a system consisting of many components all interacting with one another according to some generally simple rules can become spontaneously structured into a complex design. In Turing’s original theory these components were the morphogen molecules, which move around and react with each other. But they can also be grains of sand, plants and water, entire animals. So while Turing wrote down his theory in terms of equations that described what was happening to the morphogens everywhere, all at once, each component of the system really only needs to “know” about its own local environment: all it sees are its neighbors, and all it does is follow the rules in interacting with them. One particular set of interaction rules produces the static patterns that Turing described.
自组织世界
图灵的理论被认为是对“蚁坟”（蚂蚁在其同伴体内沉积尸体）、沙漠中沙波的排列以及海洋中浮游生物群落的斑块和犯罪发生率的解释。在城市里。这似乎是自然界的普遍原则之一，它把平淡的统一转换成有趣的、有时有用的、通常是美丽的斑块。说这是大自然发挥创造力的一种手段，这并不太奇怪。
这是一个典型的自组织例子：一个由许多组件组成的系统如何根据一些简单的规则彼此交互，可以自发地构造成一个复杂的设计。在图灵的原始理论中，这些成分是形态发生分子，它们围绕着彼此移动和反应。但它们也可以是沙粒，植物和水，整个动物。因此，当图灵用描述所有形态发生的方程式的理论写下他的理论时，系统的每个组成部分只需要“了解”它自己的本地环境：它所看到的只是它的邻居，它所做的只是遵循规则I。与他们互动。一组特定的交互规则产生图灵所描述的静态模式。

Other rules can give different structures, such as the flocking motions of birds and fish.
This seems to be how much of biology works, whether at the level of molecules interacting to build a creature or of whole communities of such creatures building their habitat. By using chemical pheromones and other signals, for example, termites coordinate with one another to construct towering nests out of mud and spittle, taller in relative terms than our own skyscrapers, and laced with chambers for the queen and her eggs, “gardens” for growing fungal food, and passageways that allow for ventilation. No one plans these edifices; they “build themselves” as each termite labors away on its own little part.

We, too, do this; our cities are best considered as organisms or ecosystems themselves, with their own metabolism, transport networks, and patterns.
No one, on the whole, plans them; they have an organic vitality, but they can also sicken and decay. That’s why we need to understand selforganization: it’s what we depend on.
其他规则可以给出不同的结构，例如鸟和鱼的植绒运动。
这似乎是多少生物的工作，无论是在分子水平的相互作用，以建立一个生物或整个社区的这种生物建立自己的栖息地。例如，通过使用化学信息素和其他信号，白蚁相互协调，从泥泞和唾沫中筑起高耸的巢穴，比我们自己的摩天大楼更高，并为女王和她的蛋绑上了腔室，“花园”用于生长真菌食物，和PAS。允许通风的通道。没有人计划这些建筑，它们“自建”，因为每一只白蚁都在自己的小部分上劳作。
我们也这样做，我们的城市最好被视为生物或生态系统本身，有他们自己的新陈代谢，运输网络和模式。
总的来说，没有人计划他们，他们有一个有机的生命力，但他们也会生病和衰败。这就是为什么我们需要理解自我组织：这是我们赖以生存的。

THE ART OF PLUMAGE
Bird feather patterns are among the most glorious displays in nature.
Some of the colors here, especially the greens and blues, are not created by pigments, but by microscopic, regular structures in the barbs that reflect light of particular wavelengths—rather like the tiny ridges of butterfly wing scales. The colors are established during feather growth, before the nascent feather gets divided up into separate barbs, so that the pattern is continuous from one barb to the next. The regularly spaced rows of barbs are themselves also thought to be produced in a biochemical patterning process.
羽毛艺术
鸟类羽毛图案是自然界中最绚丽的表现形式之一。
这里的一些颜色，特别是绿色和蓝色，不是由颜料产生的，而是由微小的，规则的结构在倒刺中反射特定波长的光，就像蝴蝶翅膀鳞片的小脊。颜色是在羽毛生长过程中形成的，在新生羽毛被分成单独的倒钩之前，这样图案从一个倒刺到另一个倒刺。规则排列的倒刺排本身也被认为是在生化图案化过程中产生的。







OFF THE SCALE
Reptiles and amphibians can sport particularly colorful markings. Some are picked out,pointillist style, in different-colored scales, as on some snake skins. Note that the underlying texture of the “canvas” is also characterized by a regular, almost geometric pattern: the polygonal divisions of a  turtle shell, the tilelike arrays of scales, the warty bumps of a chameleon’s skin.

Some markings on fish are highly orderly, such as that of the emperor angelfish (1). But the pattern produced by a single Turing-type biochemical process might change as the boundaries of the “canvas” change, so that, for example, stripes might break up into spotty markings at an edge (3). Some of these marking patterns continue to develop and shift as the fish grows, so that more stripes appear rather than a fixed pattern just expanding with increasing body size. That’s what happens, for example, for the angelfish (1 and 2).
深层设计
鱼上的一些标记是高度有序的，比如皇帝神仙鱼（1）。但是，一个图灵型生化过程所产生的图案可能随着“画布”的边界改变而改变，因此，例如，条纹可能在边缘（3）中分裂成斑点状的标记。一些标记图案随着鱼的生长而不断发展和变化，因此更多的条纹出现而不是固定的图案，只是随着体型的增大而扩展。这就是发生的事情，例如，天使鱼（1和2）。


MERGING ISLANDS
The skin of the leopard sea cucumber is marked by roughly circular islands that may merge via narrow necks if they are close enough—looking like cartoons of dividing cells. The black borders, bright “coastal waters,” and superimposed eyespots make this pattern seem all the more surreal, like the map of a strange,crater-pocked planetary surface.
合并岛屿
豹纹海参的皮肤是由大致圆形的岛屿标记的，如果它们足够接近，看起来像分裂细胞的卡通图案，那么它们可以通过狭窄的脖子合并。黑色的边界，明亮的“沿海水域”和重叠的眼点使这种模式看起来更加离奇，就像一个奇怪的，坑坑的行星表面的地图。

CHEMICAL MAZE
These patterns, produced in a Turing-type mixture of chemical reagents, constantly grow, shift, merge, and change like replicating organisms, their precise shapes and forms dependent on the exact conditions of the reaction.
化学迷宫
这些模式，在图灵型化学试剂混合物中产生，不断地生长、移位、合并和改变，如复制生物体，它们的精确形状和形式取决于反应的确切条件。


BLOOMING LOVELY
Leaves and flowers may be decorated with pigmentation, often to make them more visible to pollinating insects. The resemblance to bird plumage is explicitly acknowledged in the name of the bird of paradise plant (1).
可爱的盛开
叶和花可以用色素沉着来装饰，通常使它们对传粉昆虫更加可见。鸟类羽毛的相似性是以天堂鸟（1）的名义明确承认的。





BANDING TOGETHER
Is nature more beautiful than it “needs” to be? It is hard to find an adaptive explanation for the richness of rainbow banding of this spiderwort plant (1), while the banding in bracket fungi (2) is simply an accidental result of its periodic spells of growth, not unlike the growth rings of a tree. As the zoologist D’Arcy Thompson pointed out, some things in nature look the way they do simply because of the details of how they got to be that way: form becomes a frozen memory of growth.
捆扎在一起
自然比它“需要”更美吗？很难找到一种适应性解释这种蜘蛛纲植物的彩虹带丰富度（1），而在托架真菌中的带状（2）只是它周期性生长的偶然结果，与树的生长环不同。正如动物学家D'ARCY汤普森指出的那样，自然界中的一些事物仅仅是因为它们是如何成为这样的细节而形成的：形式变成了对生长的冻结记忆。






Glossary
Activator-inhibitor system
A pattern-forming system proposed in 1952 by Alan Turing, in which two (or more) patterning influences interact to produce patchiness, such as spots or stripes.

Convection
Movement of a fluid (a liquid or gas) usually caused by differences in density—which in turn often result from differences in temperature throughout the fluid.

Fractal
A structure or object whose shape repeats at ever finer scales.

Kármán vortex street
A regular train of vortices in a fluid flow, typically caused when the flow has to pass around some obstruction.

Logarithmic spiral
A spiral that gets “wider” with increasing distance from the center. (Strictly speaking, this spiral is a curve described by a particular mathematical equation involving logarithms.)

Phyllotaxis
The arrangement of leaves, petals, or other parts on a plant stem.

Periodic minimal surface
A surface that extends throughout threedimensional space with zero mean curvature:the “positive” and “negative” curvature of the convolutions cancel out. The surface is generally labyrinthine, with a shape that repeats again and again (is periodic), like a crystal.

Quasicrystal
A material in which the atoms are arranged in a pattern that, while never quite repeating exactly, nevertheless is orderly enough to generate sharp “crystal-like” spots in X-ray diffraction. This pattern seems to imply that the material has a “forbidden” symmetry, such as five- or eightfold.

Reaction-diffusion process
A process that involves some kind of reaction between, or combination of, its components, while they move around by random diffusion.
Such systems may generate a variety of patterns,such as moving waves or stationary patches.

Symmetry breaking
The switch from a high to a lower degree of symmetry in a system—as, for example, when a perfectly uniform system develops a pattern,which makes some directions in space different from others.

Self-organization
A process of patterning or organization arising solely from the interactions between the components of a system, rather than being imposed by some outside influence.

Self-similarity
The property in which a small part of an object looks like its whole—as, for example, with the branches of a tree. This is a typical property of fractals.

Turbulence
A state of fluid flow that is chaotic: it is impossible to fully predict, from the flow structure at one particular time, what the flow will look like at some later time. Although turbulent flow looks disorderly, some relatively orderly structures such as vortices may come and go. All flows are expected to become turbulent when they are fast enough.

Further reading

The ideas in this book are explored in more detail in my trilogy Nature’s Patterns: Shapes, Flow, and Branches 【藏书】(Oxford University Press, 2009). Those books in turn arose from an updating of The SelfMade Tapestry (Oxford University Press, 1999).
Excellent general surveys of spontaneous pattern formation in science and nature are also provided by Ian Stewart in What Shape is a Snowflake? (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2001)and Fearful Symmetry (with Martin Golubitsky,Penguin, 1993). Nice discussions of some of the biological aspects of pattern formation can be found in Brian Goodwin’s How the Leopard Changed its Spots (Princeton University Press,2001), and in Goodwin’s rather more technical collaboration with Ricard Solé, Signs of Life (Basic Books, 2000).
Even though a great deal has changed over the course of a century, nothing has diminished the scope, vision, and elegance of D’Arcy Thompson’s 1917 classic On Growth and Form, available unabridged in a 1992 Dover edition. The abridged 1961 edition published by Cambridge University Press might be less daunting for some.
And for a visual feast, it is still hard to beat (and sadly, equally hard to procure) Peter Stevens’ Patterns in Nature (Little Brown, 1979).
这本书中的思想在我的三部曲的自然模式中更详细地探究：形状、流动和分支。（牛津大学出版社，2009）。这些书又源于自编挂毯的更新（牛津大学出版社，1999）。
Ian Stewart在科学和自然中的自发模式形成的一般性调查也提供了雪花的形状？（韦登菲尔德和尼科尔森，2001）和可怕的对称性（与Martin Golubitsky，企鹅，1993）。在Brian Goodwin的《豹如何改变斑点》（普林斯顿大学出版社，2001）和古德温与里卡德•索莱的技术合作（生活基础）中，发现了一些模式形成的生物学方面的好的讨论（基础书籍，2000）。
尽管在一个世纪的过程中已经发生了很大的变化，但没有任何东西缩小了汤普森的1917个关于增长和形式的经典，在1992多佛版中没有删节。剑桥大学出版社出版的删节1961版可能不会让人感到畏惧。
对于一个视觉盛宴，仍然很难击败（同样，很难获得）Peter Stevens的自然模式（Little Brown，1979）。
